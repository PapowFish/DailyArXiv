| **[Video Editing for Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02335v2)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Though pre-training vision-language models have demonstrated significant benefits in boosting video-text retrieval performance from large-scale web videos, fine-tuning still plays a critical role with manually annotated clips with start and end times, which requires considerable human effort. To address this issue, we explore an alternative cheaper source of annotations, single timestamps, for video-text retrieval. We initialise clips from timestamps in a heuristic way to warm up a retrieval model. Then a video clip editing method is proposed to refine the initial rough boundaries to improve retrieval performance. A student-teacher network is introduced for video clip editing. The teacher model is employed to edit the clips in the training set whereas the student model trains on the edited clips. The teacher weights are updated from the student's after the student's performance increases. Our method is model agnostic and applicable to any retrieval models. We conduct experiments based on three state-of-the-art retrieval models, COOT, VideoCLIP and CLIP4Clip. Experiments conducted on three video retrieval datasets, YouCook2, DiDeMo and ActivityNet-Captions show that our edited clips consistently improve retrieval performance over initial clips across all the three retrieval models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dialogue-to-Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16761v1)** | 2023-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed an increasing amount of dialogue/conversation on the web especially on social media. That inspires the development of dialogue-based retrieval, in which retrieving videos based on dialogue is of increasing interest for recommendation systems. Different from other video retrieval tasks, dialogue-to-video retrieval uses structured queries in the form of user-generated dialogue as the search descriptor. We present a novel dialogue-to-video retrieval system, incorporating structured conversational information. Experiments conducted on the AVSD dataset show that our proposed approach using plain-text queries improves over the previous counterpart model by 15.8% on R@1. Furthermore, our approach using dialogue as a query, improves retrieval performance by 4.2%, 6.2%, 8.6% on R@1, R@5 and R@10 and outperforms the state-of-the-art model by 0.7%, 3.6% and 6.0% on R@1, R@5 and R@10 respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Content based video retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.4683v1)** | 2012-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Content based video retrieval is an approach for facilitating the searching and browsing of large image collections over World Wide Web. In this approach, video analysis is conducted on low level visual properties extracted from video frame. We believed that in order to create an effective video retrieval system, visual perception must be taken into account. We conjectured that a technique which employs multiple features for indexing and retrieval would be more effective in the discrimination and search tasks of videos. In order to validate this claim, content based indexing and retrieval systems were implemented using color histogram, various texture features and other approaches. Videos were stored in Oracle 9i Database and a user study measured correctness of response.</p></details> |  |
| **[Denoise-then-Retrieve: Text-Conditioned Video Denoising for Video Moment Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11313v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current text-driven Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) methods encode all video clips, including irrelevant ones, disrupting multimodal alignment and hindering optimization. To this end, we propose a denoise-then-retrieve paradigm that explicitly filters text-irrelevant clips from videos and then retrieves the target moment using purified multimodal representations. Following this paradigm, we introduce the Denoise-then-Retrieve Network (DRNet), comprising Text-Conditioned Denoising (TCD) and Text-Reconstruction Feedback (TRF) modules. TCD integrates cross-attention and structured state space blocks to dynamically identify noisy clips and produce a noise mask to purify multimodal video representations. TRF further distills a single query embedding from purified video representations and aligns it with the text embedding, serving as auxiliary supervision for denoising during training. Finally, we perform conditional retrieval using text embeddings on purified video representations for accurate VMR. Experiments on Charades-STA and QVHighlights demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on all metrics. Furthermore, our denoise-then-retrieve paradigm is adaptable and can be seamlessly integrated into advanced VMR models to boost performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Query Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.03639v2)** | 2022-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieving target videos based on text descriptions is a task of great practical value and has received increasing attention over the past few years. Despite recent progress, imperfect annotations in existing video retrieval datasets have posed significant challenges on model evaluation and development. In this paper, we tackle this issue by focusing on the less-studied setting of multi-query video retrieval, where multiple descriptions are provided to the model for searching over the video archive. We first show that multi-query retrieval task effectively mitigates the dataset noise introduced by imperfect annotations and better correlates with human judgement on evaluating retrieval abilities of current models. We then investigate several methods which leverage multiple queries at training time, and demonstrate that the multi-query inspired training can lead to superior performance and better generalization. We hope further investigation in this direction can bring new insights on building systems that perform better in real-world video retrieval applications.</p></details> | ECCV 2022 |
| **[On Semantic Similarity in Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.10095v1)** | 2021-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video retrieval efforts all found their evaluation on an instance-based assumption, that only a single caption is relevant to a query video and vice versa. We demonstrate that this assumption results in performance comparisons often not indicative of models' retrieval capabilities. We propose a move to semantic similarity video retrieval, where (i) multiple videos/captions can be deemed equally relevant, and their relative ranking does not affect a method's reported performance and (ii) retrieved videos/captions are ranked by their similarity to a query. We propose several proxies to estimate semantic similarities in large-scale retrieval datasets, without additional annotations. Our analysis is performed on three commonly used video retrieval datasets (MSR-VTT, YouCook2 and EPIC-KITCHENS).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2021.

| **[Interactive Video Retrieval with Dialog](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02442v1)** | 2019-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Now that everyone can easily record videos, the quantity of which is continuously increasing, research on methods for improved video retrieval is important in the contemporary world. In cases where target videos are to be identified within a large collection gathered by individuals, the appropriate information must be obtained to retrieve the correct video within a large number of similar items in the target database. The purpose of this research is to retrieve target videos in such cases by introducing an interaction, or a dialog, between the system and the user. We propose a system to retrieve videos by asking questions about the content of the videos and leveraging the user's responses to the questions. Additionally, we confirmed the usefulness of the proposed system through experiments using the dataset called AVSD which includes videos and dialogs about the videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Egocentric Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00789v4)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human actions from videos of first-person view poses significant challenges. Most prior approaches explore representation learning on egocentric videos only, while overlooking the potential benefit of exploiting existing large-scale third-person videos. In this paper, (1) we develop EgoInstructor, a retrieval-augmented multimodal captioning model that automatically retrieves semantically relevant third-person instructional videos to enhance the video captioning of egocentric videos. (2) For training the cross-view retrieval module, we devise an automatic pipeline to discover ego-exo video pairs from distinct large-scale egocentric and exocentric datasets. (3) We train the cross-view retrieval module with a novel EgoExoNCE loss that pulls egocentric and exocentric video features closer by aligning them to shared text features that describe similar actions. (4) Through extensive experiments, our cross-view retrieval module demonstrates superior performance across seven benchmarks. Regarding egocentric video captioning, EgoInstructor exhibits significant improvements by leveraging third-person videos as references.

| **[Self-supervised Video Retrieval Transformer Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07993v1)** | 2021-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Content-based video retrieval aims to find videos from a large video database that are similar to or even near-duplicate of a given query video. Video representation and similarity search algorithms are crucial to any video retrieval system. To derive effective video representation, most video retrieval systems require a large amount of manually annotated data for training, making it costly inefficient. In addition, most retrieval systems are based on frame-level features for video similarity searching, making it expensive both storage wise and search wise. We propose a novel video retrieval system, termed SVRTN, that effectively addresses the above shortcomings. It first applies self-supervised training to effectively learn video representation from unlabeled data to avoid the expensive cost of manual annotation. Then, it exploits transformer structure to aggregate frame-level features into clip-level to reduce both storage space and search complexity. It can learn the complementary and discriminative information from the interactions among clip frames, as well as acquire the frame permutation and missing invariant ability to support more flexible retrieval manners. Comprehensive experiments on two challenging video retrieval datasets, namely FIVR-200K and SVD, verify the effectiveness of our proposed SVRTN method, which achieves the best performance of video retrieval on accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Content based video retrieval systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.1641v1)** | 2012-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of multimedia data types and available bandwidth there is huge demand of video retrieval systems, as users shift from text based retrieval systems to content based retrieval systems. Selection of extracted features play an important role in content based video retrieval regardless of video attributes being under consideration. These features are intended for selecting, indexing and ranking according to their potential interest to the user. Good features selection also allows the time and space costs of the retrieval process to be reduced. This survey reviews the interesting features that can be extracted from video data for indexing and retrieval along with similarity measurement methods. We also identify present research issues in area of content based video retrieval systems.</p></details> | 18 Pages |
| **[VVS: Video-to-Video Retrieval with Irrelevant Frame Suppression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08906v2)** | 2023-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In content-based video retrieval (CBVR), dealing with large-scale collections, efficiency is as important as accuracy; thus, several video-level feature-based studies have actively been conducted. Nevertheless, owing to the severe difficulty of embedding a lengthy and untrimmed video into a single feature, these studies have been insufficient for accurate retrieval compared to frame-level feature-based studies. In this paper, we show that appropriate suppression of irrelevant frames can provide insight into the current obstacles of the video-level approaches. Furthermore, we propose a Video-to-Video Suppression network (VVS) as a solution. VVS is an end-to-end framework that consists of an easy distractor elimination stage to identify which frames to remove and a suppression weight generation stage to determine the extent to suppress the remaining frames. This structure is intended to effectively describe an untrimmed video with varying content and meaningless information. Its efficacy is proved via extensive experiments, and we show that our approach is not only state-of-the-art in video-level approaches but also has a fast inference time despite possessing retrieval capabilities close to those of frame-level approaches.

| **[T2VIndexer: A Generative Video Indexer for Efficient Text-Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11432v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current text-video retrieval methods mainly rely on cross-modal matching between queries and videos to calculate their similarity scores, which are then sorted to obtain retrieval results. This method considers the matching between each candidate video and the query, but it incurs a significant time cost and will increase notably with the increase of candidates. Generative models are common in natural language processing and computer vision, and have been successfully applied in document retrieval, but their application in multimodal retrieval remains unexplored. To enhance retrieval efficiency, in this paper, we introduce a model-based video indexer named T2VIndexer, which is a sequence-to-sequence generative model directly generating video identifiers and retrieving candidate videos with constant time complexity. T2VIndexer aims to reduce retrieval time while maintaining high accuracy. To achieve this goal, we propose video identifier encoding and query-identifier augmentation approaches to represent videos as short sequences while preserving their semantic information. Our method consistently enhances the retrieval efficiency of current state-of-the-art models on four standard datasets. It enables baselines with only 30\%-50\% of the original retrieval time to achieve better retrieval performance on MSR-VTT (+1.0%), MSVD (+1.8%), ActivityNet (+1.5%), and DiDeMo (+0.2%). The code is available at https://github.com/Lilidamowang/T2VIndexer-generativeSearch.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Lengthy Videos Retrieval Framework and Evaluation Metric](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04572v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise video retrieval requires multi-modal correlations to handle unseen vocabulary and scenes, becoming more complex for lengthy videos where models must perform effectively without prior training on a specific dataset. We introduce a unified framework that combines a visual matching stream and an aural matching stream with a unique subtitles-based video segmentation approach. Additionally, the aural stream includes a complementary audio-based two-stage retrieval mechanism that enhances performance on long-duration videos. Considering the complex nature of retrieval from lengthy videos and its corresponding evaluation, we introduce a new retrieval evaluation method specifically designed for long-video retrieval to support further research. We conducted experiments on the YouCook2 benchmark, showing promising retrieval performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Retrieve Videos by Asking Questions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.05739v3)** | 2022-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The majority of traditional text-to-video retrieval systems operate in static environments, i.e., there is no interaction between the user and the agent beyond the initial textual query provided by the user. This can be sub-optimal if the initial query has ambiguities, which would lead to many falsely retrieved videos. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel framework for Video Retrieval using Dialog (ViReD), which enables the user to interact with an AI agent via multiple rounds of dialog, where the user refines retrieved results by answering questions generated by an AI agent. Our novel multimodal question generator learns to ask questions that maximize the subsequent video retrieval performance using (i) the video candidates retrieved during the last round of interaction with the user and (ii) the text-based dialog history documenting all previous interactions, to generate questions that incorporate both visual and linguistic cues relevant to video retrieval. Furthermore, to generate maximally informative questions, we propose an Information-Guided Supervision (IGS), which guides the question generator to ask questions that would boost subsequent video retrieval accuracy. We validate the effectiveness of our interactive ViReD framework on the AVSD dataset, showing that our interactive method performs significantly better than traditional non-interactive video retrieval systems. We also demonstrate that our proposed approach generalizes to the real-world settings that involve interactions with real humans, thus, demonstrating the robustness and generality of our framework</p></details> |  |
| **[FIVR: Fine-grained Incident Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.04094v2)** | 2019-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the problem of Fine-grained Incident Video Retrieval (FIVR). Given a query video, the objective is to retrieve all associated videos, considering several types of associations that range from duplicate videos to videos from the same incident. FIVR offers a single framework that contains several retrieval tasks as special cases. To address the benchmarking needs of all such tasks, we construct and present a large-scale annotated video dataset, which we call FIVR-200K, and it comprises 225,960 videos. To create the dataset, we devise a process for the collection of YouTube videos based on major news events from recent years crawled from Wikipedia and deploy a retrieval pipeline for the automatic selection of query videos based on their estimated suitability as benchmarks. We also devise a protocol for the annotation of the dataset with respect to the four types of video associations defined by FIVR. Finally, we report the results of an experimental study on the dataset comparing five state-of-the-art methods developed based on a variety of visual descriptors, highlighting the challenges of the current problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learn to Understand Negation in Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00132v2)** | 2022-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Negation is a common linguistic skill that allows human to express what we do NOT want. Naturally, one might expect video retrieval to support natural-language queries with negation, e.g., finding shots of kids sitting on the floor and not playing with a dog. However, the state-of-the-art deep learning based video retrieval models lack such ability, as they are typically trained on video description datasets such as MSR-VTT and VATEX that lack negated descriptions. Their retrieved results basically ignore the negator in the sample query, incorrectly returning videos showing kids playing with dog. This paper presents the first study on learning to understand negation in video retrieval and make contributions as follows. By re-purposing two existing datasets (MSR-VTT and VATEX), we propose a new evaluation protocol for video retrieval with negation. We propose a learning based method for training a negation-aware video retrieval model. The key idea is to first construct a soft negative caption for a specific training video by partially negating its original caption, and then compute a bidirectionally constrained loss on the triplet. This auxiliary loss is weightedly added to a standard retrieval loss. Experiments on the re-purposed benchmarks show that re-training the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) model by the proposed method clearly improves its ability to handle queries with negation. In addition, the model performance on the original benchmarks is also improved.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM2022</p></details> |
| **[ICSVR: Investigating Compositional and Syntactic Understanding in Video Retrieval Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.16533v3)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video retrieval (VR) involves retrieving the ground truth video from the video database given a text caption or vice-versa. The two important components of compositionality: objects & attributes and actions are joined using correct syntax to form a proper text query. These components (objects & attributes, actions and syntax) each play an important role to help distinguish among videos and retrieve the correct ground truth video. However, it is unclear what is the effect of these components on the video retrieval performance. We therefore, conduct a systematic study to evaluate the compositional and syntactic understanding of video retrieval models on standard benchmarks such as MSRVTT, MSVD and DIDEMO. The study is performed on two categories of video retrieval models: (i) which are pre-trained on video-text pairs and fine-tuned on downstream video retrieval datasets (Eg. Frozen-in-Time, Violet, MCQ etc.) (ii) which adapt pre-trained image-text representations like CLIP for video retrieval (Eg. CLIP4Clip, XCLIP, CLIP2Video etc.). Our experiments reveal that actions and syntax play a minor role compared to objects & attributes in video understanding. Moreover, video retrieval models that use pre-trained image-text representations (CLIP) have better syntactic and compositional understanding as compared to models pre-trained on video-text data. The code is available at https://github.com/IntelLabs/multimodal_cognitive_ai/tree/main/ICSVR</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Audio-guided Video Representation with Gated Attention for Video-Text Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02397v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-text retrieval, the task of retrieving videos based on a textual query or vice versa, is of paramount importance for video understanding and multimodal information retrieval. Recent methods in this area rely primarily on visual and textual features and often ignore audio, although it helps enhance overall comprehension of video content. Moreover, traditional models that incorporate audio blindly utilize the audio input regardless of whether it is useful or not, resulting in suboptimal video representation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel video-text retrieval framework, Audio-guided VIdeo representation learning with GATEd attention (AVIGATE), that effectively leverages audio cues through a gated attention mechanism that selectively filters out uninformative audio signals. In addition, we propose an adaptive margin-based contrastive loss to deal with the inherently unclear positive-negative relationship between video and text, which facilitates learning better video-text alignment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that AVIGATE achieves state-of-the-art performance on all the public benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Video-Moment Retrieval and Step-Captioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16406v1)** | 2023-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is growing interest in searching for information from large video corpora. Prior works have studied relevant tasks, such as text-based video retrieval, moment retrieval, video summarization, and video captioning in isolation, without an end-to-end setup that can jointly search from video corpora and generate summaries. Such an end-to-end setup would allow for many interesting applications, e.g., a text-based search that finds a relevant video from a video corpus, extracts the most relevant moment from that video, and segments the moment into important steps with captions. To address this, we present the HiREST (HIerarchical REtrieval and STep-captioning) dataset and propose a new benchmark that covers hierarchical information retrieval and visual/textual stepwise summarization from an instructional video corpus. HiREST consists of 3.4K text-video pairs from an instructional video dataset, where 1.1K videos have annotations of moment spans relevant to text query and breakdown of each moment into key instruction steps with caption and timestamps (totaling 8.6K step captions). Our hierarchical benchmark consists of video retrieval, moment retrieval, and two novel moment segmentation and step captioning tasks. In moment segmentation, models break down a video moment into instruction steps and identify start-end boundaries. In step captioning, models generate a textual summary for each step. We also present starting point task-specific and end-to-end joint baseline models for our new benchmark. While the baseline models show some promising results, there still exists large room for future improvement by the community.

| **[Bag of Genres for Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.00051v2)** | 2020-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Often, videos are composed of multiple concepts or even genres. For instance, news videos may contain sports, action, nature, etc. Therefore, encoding the distribution of such concepts/genres in a compact and effective representation is a challenging task. In this sense, we propose the Bag of Genres representation, which is based on a visual dictionary defined by a genre classifier. Each visual word corresponds to a region in the classification space. The Bag of Genres video vector contains a summary of the activations of each genre in the video content. We evaluate the proposed method for video genre retrieval using the dataset of MediaEval Tagging Task of 2012 and for video event retrieval using the EVVE dataset. Results show that the proposed method achieves results comparable or superior to state-of-the-art methods, with the advantage of providing a much more compact representation than existing features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Circulant temporal encoding for video retrieval and temporal alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02588v2)** | 2015-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of specific video event retrieval. Given a query video of a specific event, e.g., a concert of Madonna, the goal is to retrieve other videos of the same event that temporally overlap with the query. Our approach encodes the frame descriptors of a video to jointly represent their appearance and temporal order. It exploits the properties of circulant matrices to efficiently compare the videos in the frequency domain. This offers a significant gain in complexity and accurately localizes the matching parts of videos. The descriptors can be compressed in the frequency domain with a product quantizer adapted to complex numbers. In this case, video retrieval is performed without decompressing the descriptors. We also consider the temporal alignment of a set of videos. We exploit the matching confidence and an estimate of the temporal offset computed for all pairs of videos by our retrieval approach. Our robust algorithm aligns the videos on a global timeline by maximizing the set of temporally consistent matches. The global temporal alignment enables synchronous playback of the videos of a given scene.</p></details> |  |
| **[EgoCVR: An Egocentric Benchmark for Fine-Grained Composed Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16658v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Composed Video Retrieval, a video and a textual description which modifies the video content are provided as inputs to the model. The aim is to retrieve the relevant video with the modified content from a database of videos. In this challenging task, the first step is to acquire large-scale training datasets and collect high-quality benchmarks for evaluation. In this work, we introduce EgoCVR, a new evaluation benchmark for fine-grained Composed Video Retrieval using large-scale egocentric video datasets. EgoCVR consists of 2,295 queries that specifically focus on high-quality temporal video understanding. We find that existing Composed Video Retrieval frameworks do not achieve the necessary high-quality temporal video understanding for this task. To address this shortcoming, we adapt a simple training-free method, propose a generic re-ranking framework for Composed Video Retrieval, and demonstrate that this achieves strong results on EgoCVR. Our code and benchmark are freely available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/EgoCVR.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |
| **[Video-ColBERT: Contextualized Late Interaction for Text-to-Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19009v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we tackle the problem of text-to-video retrieval (T2VR). Inspired by the success of late interaction techniques in text-document, text-image, and text-video retrieval, our approach, Video-ColBERT, introduces a simple and efficient mechanism for fine-grained similarity assessment between queries and videos. Video-ColBERT is built upon 3 main components: a fine-grained spatial and temporal token-wise interaction, query and visual expansions, and a dual sigmoid loss during training. We find that this interaction and training paradigm leads to strong individual, yet compatible, representations for encoding video content. These representations lead to increases in performance on common text-to-video retrieval benchmarks compared to other bi-encoder methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025. 13 pages, 4 figures.

| **[VideoRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation over Video Corpus](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05874v3)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful strategy for improving the factual accuracy of models by retrieving external knowledge relevant to queries and incorporating it into the generation process. However, existing approaches primarily focus on text, with some recent advancements considering images, and they largely overlook videos, a rich source of multimodal knowledge capable of representing contextual details more effectively than any other modality. While very recent studies explore the use of videos in response generation, they either predefine query-associated videos without retrieval or convert videos into textual descriptions losing multimodal richness. To tackle these, we introduce VideoRAG, a framework that not only dynamically retrieves videos based on their relevance with queries but also utilizes both visual and textual information. The operation of VideoRAG is powered by recent Large Video Language Models (LVLMs), which enable the direct processing of video content to represent it for retrieval and the seamless integration of retrieved videos jointly with queries for response generation. Also, inspired by that the context size of LVLMs may not be sufficient to process all frames in extremely long videos and not all frames are equally important, we introduce a video frame selection mechanism to extract the most informative subset of frames, along with a strategy to extract textual information from videos (as it can aid the understanding of video content) when their subtitles are not available. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of VideoRAG, showcasing that it is superior to relevant baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/starsuzi/VideoRAG.</p></details> | ACL Findings 2025 |
| **[PRVR: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.12510v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In current text-to-video retrieval (T2VR), videos to be retrieved have been properly trimmed so that a correspondence between the videos and ad-hoc textual queries naturally exists. Note in practice that videos circulated on the Internet and social media platforms, while being relatively short, are typically rich in their content. Often, multiple scenes / actions / events are shown in a single video, leading to a more challenging T2VR setting wherein only part of the video content is relevant w.r.t. a given query. This paper presents a first study on this setting which we term Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR). Considering that a video typically consists of multiple moments, a video is regarded as partially relevant w.r.t. to a given query if it contains a query-related moment. We formulate the PRVR task as a multiple instance learning problem, and propose a Multi-Scale Similarity Learning (MS-SL++) network that jointly learns both clip-scale and frame-scale similarities to determine the partial relevance between video-query pairs. Extensive experiments on three diverse video-text datasets (TVshow Retrieval, ActivityNet-Captions and Charades-STA) demonstrate the viability of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI.

| **[In-Style: Bridging Text and Uncurated Videos with Style Transfer for Text-Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.08928v1)** | 2023-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale noisy web image-text datasets have been proven to be efficient for learning robust vision-language models. However, when transferring them to the task of video retrieval, models still need to be fine-tuned on hand-curated paired text-video data to adapt to the diverse styles of video descriptions. To address this problem without the need for hand-annotated pairs, we propose a new setting, text-video retrieval with uncurated & unpaired data, that during training utilizes only text queries together with uncurated web videos without any paired text-video data. To this end, we propose an approach, In-Style, that learns the style of the text queries and transfers it to uncurated web videos. Moreover, to improve generalization, we show that one model can be trained with multiple text styles. To this end, we introduce a multi-style contrastive training procedure that improves the generalizability over several datasets simultaneously. We evaluate our model on retrieval performance over multiple datasets to demonstrate the advantages of our style transfer framework on the new task of uncurated & unpaired text-video retrieval and improve state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot text-video retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICCV 2023, code: https://github.com/ninatu/in_style</p></details> |
| **[Improving Video Retrieval by Adaptive Margin](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05093v1)** | 2023-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video retrieval is becoming increasingly important owing to the rapid emergence of videos on the Internet. The dominant paradigm for video retrieval learns video-text representations by pushing the distance between the similarity of positive pairs and that of negative pairs apart from a fixed margin. However, negative pairs used for training are sampled randomly, which indicates that the semantics between negative pairs may be related or even equivalent, while most methods still enforce dissimilar representations to decrease their similarity. This phenomenon leads to inaccurate supervision and poor performance in learning video-text representations. While most video retrieval methods overlook that phenomenon, we propose an adaptive margin changed with the distance between positive and negative pairs to solve the aforementioned issue. First, we design the calculation framework of the adaptive margin, including the method of distance measurement and the function between the distance and the margin. Then, we explore a novel implementation called "Cross-Modal Generalized Self-Distillation" (CMGSD), which can be built on the top of most video retrieval models with few modifications. Notably, CMGSD adds few computational overheads at train time and adds no computational overhead at test time. Experimental results on three widely used datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can yield significantly better performance than the corresponding backbone model, and it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2021</p></details> |
| **[Multi-event Video-Text Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.11551v2)** | 2023-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-Text Retrieval (VTR) is a crucial multi-modal task in an era of massive video-text data on the Internet. A plethora of work characterized by using a two-stream Vision-Language model architecture that learns a joint representation of video-text pairs has become a prominent approach for the VTR task. However, these models operate under the assumption of bijective video-text correspondences and neglect a more practical scenario where video content usually encompasses multiple events, while texts like user queries or webpage metadata tend to be specific and correspond to single events. This establishes a gap between the previous training objective and real-world applications, leading to the potential performance degradation of earlier models during inference. In this study, we introduce the Multi-event Video-Text Retrieval (MeVTR) task, addressing scenarios in which each video contains multiple different events, as a niche scenario of the conventional Video-Text Retrieval Task. We present a simple model, Me-Retriever, which incorporates key event video representation and a new MeVTR loss for the MeVTR task. Comprehensive experiments show that this straightforward framework outperforms other models in the Video-to-Text and Text-to-Video tasks, effectively establishing a robust baseline for the MeVTR task. We believe this work serves as a strong foundation for future studies.

| **[Graph Based Temporal Aggregation for Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.02426v1)** | 2020-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large scale video retrieval is a field of study with a lot of ongoing research. Most of the work in the field is on video retrieval through text queries using techniques such as VSE++. However, there is little research done on video retrieval through image queries, and the work that has been done in this field either uses image queries from within the video dataset or iterates through videos frame by frame. These approaches are not generalized for queries from outside the dataset and do not scale well for large video datasets. To overcome these issues, we propose a new approach for video retrieval through image queries where an undirected graph is constructed from the combined set of frames from all videos to be searched. The node features of this graph are used in the task of video retrieval. Experimentation is done on the MSR-VTT dataset by using query images from outside the dataset. To evaluate this novel approach P@5, P@10 and P@20 metrics are calculated. Two different ResNet models namely, ResNet-152 and ResNet-50 are used in this study.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

The existing video retrieval and caption benchmarks only include short descriptions, limits their ability of detailed video understanding evaluation. To address this problem, we present CaReBench, a testing benchmark for fine-grained video captioning and retrieval with 1,000 high-quality pairs of videos and human-annotated detailed captions. Uniquely, it provides manually separated spatial annotations and temporal annotations for each video. Based on this design, we introduce two evaluation metrics, ReBias and CapST, specifically tailored for video retrieval and video captioning tasks, respectively. These metrics enable a comprehensive investigation into the spatial and temporal biases inherent in VLMs. In addition, to handle both video retrieval and video captioning tasks in a unified framework, we develop a simple baseline based on a Multimodal Language Model (MLLM). By implementing a two-stage Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), we fully unlock the potential of MLLM, enabling it not only to generate detailed video descriptions but also to extract video features. Surprisingly, experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the CLIP-based models designed for retrieval and the popular MLLMs skilled in video captioning, our baseline shows competitive performance in both fine-grained video retrieval and video detailed captioning.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods rely solely on aligning video and text modalities to compute the similarity and retrieve relevant items. However, recent advancements emphasise incorporating auxiliary information extracted from video and text modalities to improve retrieval performance and bridge the semantic gap between these modalities. Auxiliary information can include visual attributes, such as objects; temporal and spatial context; and textual descriptions, such as speech and rephrased captions. This survey comprehensively reviews 81 research papers on Text-to-Video retrieval that utilise such auxiliary information. It provides a detailed analysis of their methodologies; highlights state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets; and discusses available datasets and their auxiliary information. Additionally, it proposes promising directions for future research, focusing on different ways to further enhance retrieval performance using this information.</p></details> |  |

The intricate and abundant context of the video challenges the performance and efficiency of TVR. To handle the serialized video contexts, existing methods typically select a subset of frames within a video to represent the video content for TVR. How to select the most representative frames is a crucial issue, whereby the selected frames are required to not only retain the semantic information of the video but also promote retrieval efficiency by excluding temporally redundant frames. In this paper, we make the first empirical study of frame selection for TVR. We systemically classify existing frame selection methods into text-free and text-guided ones, under which we detailedly analyze six different frame selections in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Among them, two frame selections are first developed in this paper. According to the comprehensive analysis on multiple TVR benchmarks, we empirically conclude that the TVR with proper frame selections can significantly improve the retrieval efficiency without sacrificing the retrieval performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2023 EMNLP findings</p></details> |

In this paper, we convert traditional video captioning task into a new paradigm, \ie, Open-book Video Captioning, which generates natural language under the prompts of video-content-relevant sentences, not limited to the video itself. To address the open-book video captioning problem, we propose a novel Retrieve-Copy-Generate network, where a pluggable video-to-text retriever is constructed to retrieve sentences as hints from the training corpus effectively, and a copy-mechanism generator is introduced to extract expressions from multi-retrieved sentences dynamically. The two modules can be trained end-to-end or separately, which is flexible and extensible. Our framework coordinates the conventional retrieval-based methods with orthodox encoder-decoder methods, which can not only draw on the diverse expressions in the retrieved sentences but also generate natural and accurate content of the video. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that our proposed approach surpasses the state-of-the-art performance, indicating the effectiveness and promising of the proposed paradigm in the task of video captioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2021</p></details> |

Since logos occupy only a small area in the videos, the popular methods of image retrieval could fail. This paper develops an algorithm called Video Logo Retrieval (VLR), which is an image-to-video retrieval algorithm based on the spatial distribution of local image descriptors that measure the distance between the query image (the logo) and a collection of video images. VLR uses local features to overcome the weakness of global feature-based models such as convolutional neural networks (CNN). Meanwhile, VLR is flexible and does not require training after setting some hyper-parameters. The performance of VLR is evaluated on two challenging open benchmark tasks (SoccerNet and Standford I2V), and compared with other state-of-the-art logo retrieval or detection algorithms. Overall, VLR shows significantly higher accuracy compared with the existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICIP 20.

| **[Video Corpus Moment Retrieval with Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.06247v1)** | 2021-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a collection of untrimmed and unsegmented videos, video corpus moment retrieval (VCMR) is to retrieve a temporal moment (i.e., a fraction of a video) that semantically corresponds to a given text query. As video and text are from two distinct feature spaces, there are two general approaches to address VCMR: (i) to separately encode each modality representations, then align the two modality representations for query processing, and (ii) to adopt fine-grained cross-modal interaction to learn multi-modal representations for query processing. While the second approach often leads to better retrieval accuracy, the first approach is far more efficient. In this paper, we propose a Retrieval and Localization Network with Contrastive Learning (ReLoCLNet) for VCMR. We adopt the first approach and introduce two contrastive learning objectives to refine video encoder and text encoder to learn video and text representations separately but with better alignment for VCMR. The video contrastive learning (VideoCL) is to maximize mutual information between query and candidate video at video-level. The frame contrastive learning (FrameCL) aims to highlight the moment region corresponds to the query at frame-level, within a video. Experimental results show that, although ReLoCLNet encodes text and video separately for efficiency, its retrieval accuracy is comparable with baselines adopting cross-modal interaction learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures and 6 tables.

The current task formulation assumes that the queried moment is present in the video, resulting in false positive moment predictions when irrelevant query sentences are provided. In this paper we propose the task of Negative-Aware Video Moment Retrieval (NA-VMR), which considers both moment retrieval accuracy and negative query rejection accuracy. We make the distinction between In-Domain and Out-of-Domain negative queries and provide new evaluation benchmarks for two popular video moment retrieval datasets: QVHighlights and Charades-STA. We analyse the ability of current SOTA video moment retrieval approaches to adapt to Negative-Aware Video Moment Retrieval and propose UniVTG-NA, an adaptation of UniVTG designed to tackle NA-VMR. UniVTG-NA achieves high negative rejection accuracy (avg. $98.4\%$) scores while retaining moment retrieval scores to within $3.87\%$ Recall@1.

Traditional VideoQA systems struggle with long videos, as they must process entire videos before responding to queries, and repeat this process for each new question. In contrast, our approach analyzes long videos in a streaming manner, allowing for prompt responses as soon as user queries are received. Building on a common Video-LLM, we first incorporate a sliding-window attention mechanism, ensuring that input frames attend to a limited number of preceding frames, thereby reducing computational overhead. To prevent information loss, we store processed video key-value caches (KV-Caches) in RAM and disk, reloading them into GPU memory as needed. Additionally, we introduce a retrieval method that leverages an external retriever or the parameters within Video-LLMs to retrieve only query-relevant KV-Caches, ensuring both efficiency and accuracy in question answering. ReKV enables the separation of video encoding and question-answering across different processes and GPUs, significantly enhancing the efficiency of StreamingVQA. Through comprehensive experimentation, we validate the efficacy and practicality of our approach, which significantly boosts efficiency and enhances applicability over existing VideoQA models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[Event-aware Video Corpus Moment Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13566v1)** | 2024-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Corpus Moment Retrieval (VCMR) is a practical video retrieval task focused on identifying a specific moment within a vast corpus of untrimmed videos using the natural language query. Existing methods for VCMR typically rely on frame-aware video retrieval, calculating similarities between the query and video frames to rank videos based on maximum frame similarity.However, this approach overlooks the semantic structure embedded within the information between frames, namely, the event, a crucial element for human comprehension of videos. Motivated by this, we propose EventFormer, a model that explicitly utilizes events within videos as fundamental units for video retrieval. The model extracts event representations through event reasoning and hierarchical event encoding. The event reasoning module groups consecutive and visually similar frame representations into events, while the hierarchical event encoding encodes information at both the frame and event levels. We also introduce anchor multi-head self-attenion to encourage Transformer to capture the relevance of adjacent content in the video. The training of EventFormer is conducted by two-branch contrastive learning and dual optimization for two sub-tasks of VCMR. Extensive experiments on TVR, ANetCaps, and DiDeMo benchmarks show the effectiveness and efficiency of EventFormer in VCMR, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Additionally, the effectiveness of EventFormer is also validated on partially relevant video retrieval task.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Long Video Understanding with Learnable Retrieval in Video-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.04931v3)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have made them attractive for application to video understanding, utilizing video tokens as contextual input. However, employing LLMs for long video understanding presents significant challenges. The extensive number of video tokens leads to considerable computational costs for LLMs while using aggregated tokens results in loss of vision details. Moreover, the presence of abundant question-irrelevant tokens introduces noise to the video reasoning process. To address these issues, we introduce a simple yet effective learnable retrieval-based video-language model (R-VLM) for efficient long video understanding. Specifically, given a question (query) and a long video, our model identifies and selects the most relevant K video chunks and uses their associated visual tokens to serve as context for the LLM inference. This effectively reduces the number of video tokens, eliminates noise interference, and enhances system performance. We achieve this by incorporating a learnable lightweight MLP block to facilitate the efficient retrieval of question-relevant chunks, through the end-to-end training of our video-language model with a proposed soft matching loss. Our experimental results on multiple zero-shot video question answering datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework for comprehending long videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> |

However, it is time consuming and challenging to effectively retrieve and present numerous lecture videos for common users. In this work, we propose a hierarchical visual interface for retrieving and summarizing lecture videos. Users can utilize the proposed interface to effectively explore the required video information through the results of the video summary generation in different layers. We retrieve the input keywords with the corresponding video layer with timestamps, a frame layer with slides, and the poster layer with summarization of the lecture videos.

| **[Improving Video Corpus Moment Retrieval with Partial Relevance Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13576v2)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Corpus Moment Retrieval (VCMR) is a new video retrieval task aimed at retrieving a relevant moment from a large corpus of untrimmed videos using a text query. The relevance between the video and query is partial, mainly evident in two aspects:~(1)~Scope: The untrimmed video contains many frames, but not all are relevant to the query. Strong relevance is typically observed only within the relevant moment.~(2)~Modality: The relevance of the query varies with different modalities. Action descriptions align more with visual elements, while character conversations are more related to textual information.Existing methods often treat all video contents equally, leading to sub-optimal moment retrieval. We argue that effectively capturing the partial relevance between the query and video is essential for the VCMR task. To this end, we propose a Partial Relevance Enhanced Model~(PREM) to improve VCMR. VCMR involves two sub-tasks: video retrieval and moment localization. To align with their distinct objectives, we implement specialized partial relevance enhancement strategies. For video retrieval, we introduce a multi-modal collaborative video retriever, generating different query representations for the two modalities by modality-specific pooling, ensuring a more effective match. For moment localization, we propose the focus-then-fuse moment localizer, utilizing modality-specific gates to capture essential content. We also introduce relevant content-enhanced training methods for both retriever and localizer to enhance the ability of model to capture relevant content. Experimental results on TVR and DiDeMo datasets show that the proposed model outperforms the baselines, achieving a new state-of-the-art of VCMR.

| **[Live Laparoscopic Video Retrieval with Compressed Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.04301v2)** | 2023-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Searching through large volumes of medical data to retrieve relevant information is a challenging yet crucial task for clinical care. However the primitive and most common approach to retrieval, involving text in the form of keywords, is severely limited when dealing with complex media formats. Content-based retrieval offers a way to overcome this limitation, by using rich media as the query itself. Surgical video-to-video retrieval in particular is a new and largely unexplored research problem with high clinical value, especially in the real-time case: using real-time video hashing, search can be achieved directly inside of the operating room. Indeed, the process of hashing converts large data entries into compact binary arrays or hashes, enabling large-scale search operations at a very fast rate. However, due to fluctuations over the course of a video, not all bits in a given hash are equally reliable. In this work, we propose a method capable of mitigating this uncertainty while maintaining a light computational footprint. We present superior retrieval results (3-4 % top 10 mean average precision) on a multi-task evaluation protocol for surgery, using cholecystectomy phases, bypass phases, and coming from an entirely new dataset introduced here, critical events across six different surgery types. Success on this multi-task benchmark shows the generalizability of our approach for surgical video retrieval.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |

We propose a novel system that induces schemata from web videos and generalizes them to capture unseen tasks with the goal of improving video retrieval performance. Our system proceeds in three major phases: (1) Given a task with related videos, we construct an initial schema for a task using a joint video-text model to match video segments with text representing steps from wikiHow; (2) We generalize schemata to unseen tasks by leveraging language models to edit the text within existing schemata. Through generalization, we can allow our schemata to cover a more extensive range of tasks with a small amount of learning data; (3) We conduct zero-shot instructional video retrieval with the unseen task names as the queries. Our schema-guided approach outperforms existing methods for video retrieval, and we demonstrate that the schemata induced by our system are better than those generated by other models.</p></details> |  |

Most of the existing methods for this caption-to-video retrieval problem do not fully exploit cross-modal cues present in video. Furthermore, they aggregate per-frame visual features with limited or no temporal information. In this paper, we present a multi-modal transformer to jointly encode the different modalities in video, which allows each of them to attend to the others. The transformer architecture is also leveraged to encode and model the temporal information. On the natural language side, we investigate the best practices to jointly optimize the language embedding together with the multi-modal transformer.

Previous dominant works mainly adopt two separate encoders for efficient retrieval, but ignore local associations between videos and texts. Another line of research uses a joint encoder to interact video with texts, but results in low efficiency since each text-video pair needs to be fed into the model. In this work, we enable fine-grained video-text interactions while maintaining high efficiency for retrieval via a novel pretext task, dubbed as Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ), where a parametric module BridgeFormer is trained to answer the "questions" constructed by the text features via resorting to the video features. Specifically, we exploit the rich semantics of text (i.e., nouns and verbs) to build questions, with which the video encoder can be trained to capture more regional content and temporal dynamics. In the form of questions and answers, the semantic associations between local video-text features can be properly established. BridgeFormer is able to be removed for downstream retrieval, rendering an efficient and flexible model with only two encoders. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the popular text-to-video retrieval task in five datasets with different experimental setups (i.e., zero-shot and fine-tune), including HowTo100M (one million videos). We further conduct zero-shot action recognition, which can be cast as video-to-text retrieval, and our approach also significantly surpasses its counterparts. As an additional benefit, our method achieves competitive results with much shorter pre-training videos on single-modality downstream tasks, e.g., action recognition with linear evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2022</p></details> |

However, web-crawled pre-training datasets often lack sufficient event information, and the widely adopted video-level cross-modal contrastive learning also struggles to capture detailed and complex video-text event alignment. To address these challenges, we make improvements from both data and model perspectives. In terms of pre-training data, we focus on supplementing the missing specific event content and event temporal transitions with the proposed event augmentation strategies. Based on the event-augmented data, we construct a novel Event-Aware Video-Text Retrieval model, ie, EA-VTR, which achieves powerful video-text retrieval ability through superior video event awareness. EA-VTR can efficiently encode frame-level and video-level visual representations simultaneously, enabling detailed event content and complex event temporal cross-modal alignment, ultimately enhancing the comprehensive understanding of video events. Our method not only significantly outperforms existing approaches on multiple datasets for Text-to-Video Retrieval and Video Action Recognition tasks, but also demonstrates superior event content perceive ability on Multi-event Video-Text Retrieval and Video Moment Retrieval tasks, as well as outstanding event temporal logic understanding ability on Test of Time task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024</p></details> |
| **[Modality-Balanced Embedding for Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.08182v2)** | 2022-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video search has become the main routine for users to discover videos relevant to a text query on large short-video sharing platforms. During training a query-video bi-encoder model using online search logs, we identify a modality bias phenomenon that the video encoder almost entirely relies on text matching, neglecting other modalities of the videos such as vision, audio. This modality imbalanceresults from a) modality gap: the relevance between a query and a video text is much easier to learn as the query is also a piece of text, with the same modality as the video text; b) data bias: most training samples can be solved solely by text matching. Here we share our practices to improve the first retrieval stage including our solution for the modality imbalance issue. We propose MBVR (short for Modality Balanced Video Retrieval) with two key components: manually generated modality-shuffled (MS) samples and a dynamic margin (DM) based on visual relevance. They can encourage the video encoder to pay balanced attentions to each modality. Through extensive experiments on a real world dataset, we show empirically that our method is both effective and efficient in solving modality bias problem. We have also deployed our MBVR in a large video platform and observed statistically significant boost over a highly optimized baseline in an A/B test and manual GSB evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR-2022, short paper</p></details> |

Recent works have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in video retrieval by adopting CLIP, effectively hitchhiking on the image-text representation for video tasks. However, there has been limited success in learning temporal aggregation that outperform mean-pooling the image-level representations extracted per frame by CLIP. We find that the simple yet effective baseline of weighted-mean of frame embeddings via query-scoring is a significant improvement above all prior temporal modelling attempts and mean-pooling. In doing so, we provide an improved baseline for others to compare to and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of this simple baseline on a suite of long video retrieval benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Start from Video-Music Retrieval: An Inter-Intra Modal Loss for Cross Modal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19415v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The burgeoning short video industry has accelerated the advancement of video-music retrieval technology, assisting content creators in selecting appropriate music for their videos. In self-supervised training for video-to-music retrieval, the video and music samples in the dataset are separated from the same video work, so they are all one-to-one matches. This does not match the real situation. In reality, a video can use different music as background music, and a music can be used as background music for different videos. Many videos and music that are not in a pair may be compatible, leading to false negative noise in the dataset. A novel inter-intra modal (II) loss is proposed as a solution. By reducing the variation of feature distribution within the two modalities before and after the encoder, II loss can reduce the model's overfitting to such noise without removing it in a costly and laborious way. The video-music retrieval framework, II-CLVM (Contrastive Learning for Video-Music Retrieval), incorporating the II Loss, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the YouTube8M dataset. The framework II-CLVTM shows better performance when retrieving music using multi-modal video information (such as text in videos). Experiments are designed to show that II loss can effectively alleviate the problem of false negative noise in retrieval tasks. Experiments also show that II loss improves various self-supervised and supervised uni-modal and cross-modal retrieval tasks, and can obtain good retrieval models with a small amount of training samples.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[A Large Cross-Modal Video Retrieval Dataset with Reading Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.03347v1)** | 2023-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing cross-modal language-to-video retrieval (VR) research focuses on single-modal input from video, i.e., visual representation, while the text is omnipresent in human environments and frequently critical to understand video. To study how to retrieve video with both modal inputs, i.e., visual and text semantic representations, we first introduce a large-scale and cross-modal Video Retrieval dataset with text reading comprehension, TextVR, which contains 42.2k sentence queries for 10.5k videos of 8 scenario domains, i.e., Street View (indoor), Street View (outdoor), Games, Sports, Driving, Activity, TV Show, and Cooking. The proposed TextVR requires one unified cross-modal model to recognize and comprehend texts, relate them to the visual context, and decide what text semantic information is vital for the video retrieval task. Besides, we present a detailed analysis of TextVR compared to the existing datasets and design a novel multimodal video retrieval baseline for the text-based video retrieval task. The dataset analysis and extensive experiments show that our TextVR benchmark provides many new technical challenges and insights from previous datasets for the video-and-language community.

Existing works predominantly rely on visual queries combined with modification text to distinguish relevant videos. However, such a strategy struggles to fully preserve the rich query-specific context in retrieved target videos and only represents the target video using visual embedding. We introduce a novel CoVR framework that leverages detailed language descriptions to explicitly encode query-specific contextual information and learns discriminative embeddings of vision only, text only and vision-text for better alignment to accurately retrieve matched target videos. Our proposed framework can be flexibly employed for both composed video (CoVR) and image (CoIR) retrieval tasks. Experiments on three datasets show that our approach obtains state-of-the-art performance for both CovR and zero-shot CoIR tasks, achieving gains as high as around 7% in terms of recall@K=1 score.

Users usually retrieve ASMR contents from various video websites using only keywords. However, it is challenging to examine satisfactory contents to reflect users' needs for ASMR videos using keywords or content-based retrieval. To solve this issue, we propose a perceptual video retrieval system for ASMR videos and provide a novel retrieval user interface that allows users to retrieve content according to watching purpose and anticipated expectations, such as excitement, calmness, stress and sadness. An ASMR video perception dataset is constructed with annotations on affective responses after watching the videos. To verify the proposed video retrieval system, a user study is conducted showing that users can retrieve satisfactory ASMR contents easily and efficiently compared to conventional keywords-based retrieval systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, in proceedings of HCII2022</p></details> |

We propose a framework for video-to-adverb retrieval (and vice versa) that aligns video embeddings with their matching compositional adverb-action text embedding in a joint embedding space. The compositional adverb-action text embedding is learned using a residual gating mechanism, along with a novel training objective consisting of triplet losses and a regression target. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on five recent benchmarks for video-adverb retrieval. Furthermore, we introduce dataset splits to benchmark video-adverb retrieval for unseen adverb-action compositions on subsets of the MSR-VTT Adverbs and ActivityNet Adverbs datasets. Our proposed framework outperforms all prior works for the generalisation task of retrieving adverbs from videos for unseen adverb-action compositions.

| **[Task Presentation and Human Perception in Interactive Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04279v1)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive video retrieval is a cooperative process between humans and retrieval systems. Large-scale evaluation campaigns, however, often overlook human factors, such as the effects of perception, attention, and memory, when assessing media retrieval systems. Consequently, their setups fall short of emulating realistic retrieval scenarios. In this paper, we design novel task presentation modes based on concepts in media memorability, implement the pipelines necessary for processing target video segments, and build a custom experimental platform for the final evaluation. In order to study the effects of different task representation schemes, we conduct a large crowdsourced experiment. Our findings demonstrate that the way in which the target of a video retrieval task is presented has a substantial influence on the difficulty of the retrieval task and that individuals can successfully retrieve a target video segment despite reducing or even altering the provided hints, opening up a discussion around future evaluation protocols in the domain of interactive media retrieval.</p></details> |  |

In general, this retrieval task is composed of four successive steps: video and textual feature representation extraction, feature embedding and matching, and objective functions. In the last, a list of samples retrieved from the dataset is ranked based on their matching similarities to the query. In recent years, significant and flourishing progress has been achieved by deep learning techniques, however, VTR is still a challenging task due to the problems like how to learn an efficient spatial-temporal video feature and how to narrow the cross-modal gap. In this survey, we review and summarize over 100 research papers related to VTR, demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on several commonly benchmarked datasets, and discuss potential challenges and directions, with the expectation to provide some insights for researchers in the field of video-text retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Journal of Multimedia Information Retrieval (IJMIR)</p></details> |

Recently, there has been renewed interest in interactive systems to enhance retrieval, but existing approaches are complex and deliver limited gains in performance. In this work, we revisit this topic and propose several simple yet effective baselines for interactive video retrieval via question-answering. We employ a VideoQA model to simulate user interactions and show that this enables the productive study of the interactive retrieval task without access to ground truth dialogue data. Experiments on MSR-VTT, MSVD, and AVSD show that our framework using question-based interaction significantly improves the performance of text-based video retrieval systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2023, project page: https://github.com/kevinliang888/IVR-QA-baselines</p></details> |

In this work, however, we reveal that cross-modal contrastive learning suffers from incorrect normalization of the sum retrieval probabilities of each text or video instance. Specifically, we show that many test instances are either over- or under-represented during retrieval, significantly hurting the retrieval performance. To address this problem, we propose Normalized Contrastive Learning (NCL) which utilizes the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm to compute the instance-wise biases that properly normalize the sum retrieval probabilities of each instance so that every text and video instance is fairly represented during cross-modal retrieval. Empirical study shows that NCL brings consistent and significant gains in text-video retrieval on different model architectures, with new state-of-the-art multimodal retrieval metrics on the ActivityNet, MSVD, and MSR-VTT datasets without any architecture engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in EMNLP 2022</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Cross-Modal Video Retrieval with Meta-Optimized Frames](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.08452v1)** | 2022-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-modal video retrieval aims to retrieve the semantically relevant videos given a text as a query, and is one of the fundamental tasks in Multimedia. Most of top-performing methods primarily leverage Visual Transformer (ViT) to extract video features [1, 2, 3], suffering from high computational complexity of ViT especially for encoding long videos. A common and simple solution is to uniformly sample a small number (say, 4 or 8) of frames from the video (instead of using the whole video) as input to ViT. The number of frames has a strong influence on the performance of ViT, e.g., using 8 frames performs better than using 4 frames yet needs more computational resources, resulting in a trade-off. To get free from this trade-off, this paper introduces an automatic video compression method based on a bilevel optimization program (BOP) consisting of both model-level (i.e., base-level) and frame-level (i.e., meta-level) optimizations. The model-level learns a cross-modal video retrieval model whose input is the "compressed frames" learned by frame-level optimization. In turn, the frame-level optimization is through gradient descent using the meta loss of video retrieval model computed on the whole video. We call this BOP method as well as the "compressed frames" as Meta-Optimized Frames (MOF). By incorporating MOF, the video retrieval model is able to utilize the information of whole videos (for training) while taking only a small number of input frames in actual implementation. The convergence of MOF is guaranteed by meta gradient descent algorithms. For evaluation, we conduct extensive experiments of cross-modal video retrieval on three large-scale benchmarks: MSR-VTT, MSVD, and DiDeMo. Our results show that MOF is a generic and efficient method to boost multiple baseline methods, and can achieve a new state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual Encoding for Zero-Example Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06181v3)** | 2019-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper attacks the challenging problem of zero-example video retrieval. In such a retrieval paradigm, an end user searches for unlabeled videos by ad-hoc queries described in natural language text with no visual example provided. Given videos as sequences of frames and queries as sequences of words, an effective sequence-to-sequence cross-modal matching is required. The majority of existing methods are concept based, extracting relevant concepts from queries and videos and accordingly establishing associations between the two modalities. In contrast, this paper takes a concept-free approach, proposing a dual deep encoding network that encodes videos and queries into powerful dense representations of their own. Dual encoding is conceptually simple, practically effective and end-to-end. As experiments on three benchmarks, i.e. MSR-VTT, TRECVID 2016 and 2017 Ad-hoc Video Search show, the proposed solution establishes a new state-of-the-art for zero-example video retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2019.

However, existing benchmarks suffer from limited video duration, low-quality captions, and coarse annotation granularity, which hinder the evaluation of advanced video-text retrieval methods. To address these limitations, we introduce LoVR, a benchmark specifically designed for long video-text retrieval. LoVR contains 467 long videos and over 40,804 fine-grained clips with high-quality captions. To overcome the issue of poor machine-generated annotations, we propose an efficient caption generation framework that integrates VLM automatic generation, caption quality scoring, and dynamic refinement. This pipeline improves annotation accuracy while maintaining scalability. Furthermore, we introduce a semantic fusion method to generate coherent full-video captions without losing important contextual information. Our benchmark introduces longer videos, more detailed captions, and a larger-scale dataset, presenting new challenges for video understanding and retrieval. Extensive experiments on various advanced embedding models demonstrate that LoVR is a challenging benchmark, revealing the limitations of current approaches and providing valuable insights for future research.

However, identifying the best music for a video can be a difficult and time-consuming task. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for automatically retrieving a matching music clip for a given video, and vice versa. Our approach leverages annotated music labels, as well as the inherent artistic correspondence between visual and music elements. Distinct from previous cross-modal music retrieval works, our method combines both self-supervised and supervised training objectives. We use self-supervised and label-supervised contrastive learning to train a joint embedding space between music and video. We show the effectiveness of our approach by using music genre labels for the supervised training component, and our framework can be generalized to other music annotations (e.g., emotion, instrument, etc.). Furthermore, our method enables fine-grained control over how much the retrieval process focuses on self-supervised vs. label information at inference time. We evaluate the learned embeddings through a variety of video-to-music and music-to-video retrieval tasks. Our experiments show that the proposed approach successfully combines self-supervised and supervised objectives and is effective for controllable music-video retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

Unlike previous approaches designed for short video retrieval (e.g., 5-15 seconds in duration), our approach aims to retrieve minute-long videos that capture complex human actions. One challenge of standard video-only approaches is the large computational cost associated with processing hundreds of densely extracted frames from such long videos. To address this issue, we propose to replace parts of the video with compact audio cues that succinctly summarize dynamic audio events and are cheap to process. Our method, named ECLIPSE (Efficient CLIP with Sound Encoding), adapts the popular CLIP model to an audiovisual video setting, by adding a unified audiovisual transformer block that captures complementary cues from the video and audio streams. In addition to being 2.92x faster and 2.34x memory-efficient than long-range video-only approaches, our method also achieves better text-to-video retrieval accuracy on several diverse long-range video datasets such as ActivityNet, QVHighlights, YouCook2, DiDeMo and Charades.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2022 Oral project page: https://yanbo.ml/project_page/eclipse/</p></details> |

This framework effectively captures the state-relatedness in long-term video content and seamlessly integrates it into text-video relevance understanding, thereby enhancing the retrieval process. Specifically, we introduce Temporal T-to-V Fusion and Temporal V-to-T Fusion to explicitly model temporal relationships between text queries and video moments, improving contextual awareness and retrieval accuracy.

However, in real-world scenarios, online videos are often accompanied by relevant text information such as titles, tags, and even subtitles, which can be utilized to match textual queries. This insight has motivated us to propose a novel approach to text-video retrieval, where we directly generate associated captions from videos using zero-shot video captioning with knowledge from web-scale pre-trained models (e.g., CLIP and GPT-2). Given the generated captions, a natural question arises: what benefits do they bring to text-video retrieval? To answer this, we introduce Cap4Video, a new framework that leverages captions in three ways: i) Input data: video-caption pairs can augment the training data. ii) Intermediate feature interaction: we perform cross-modal feature interaction between the video and caption to produce enhanced video representations. iii) Output score: the Query-Caption matching branch can complement the original Query-Video matching branch for text-video retrieval. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Without any post-processing, Cap4Video achieves state-of-the-art performance on four standard text-video retrieval benchmarks: MSR-VTT (51.4%), VATEX (66.6%), MSVD (51.8%), and DiDeMo (52.0%).

The creation of large scale datasets of videos such as the YouTube-8M allows us to deal with this large amount of data in manageable way. In this work, we find new ways of exploiting this dataset by taking advantage of the multi-modal information it provides. By means of a neural network, we are able to create links between audio and visual documents, by projecting them into a common region of the feature space, obtaining joint audio-visual embeddings. These links are used to retrieve audio samples that fit well to a given silent video, and also to retrieve images that match a given a query audio. The results in terms of Recall@K obtained over a subset of YouTube-8M videos show the potential of this unsupervised approach for cross-modal feature learning. We train embeddings for both scales and assess their quality in a retrieval problem, formulated as using the feature extracted from one modality to retrieve the most similar videos based on the features computed in the other modality.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

Nevertheless, due to the lack of dynamic information provided by isolated frames, the performance is hampered when the person is obscured or variable motion details are missed in isolated frames. To overcome this, we propose a novel Text-to-Video Person Retrieval (TVPR) task. Since there is no dataset or benchmark that describes person videos with natural language, we construct a large-scale cross-modal person video dataset containing detailed natural language annotations, termed as Text-to-Video Person Re-identification (TVPReid) dataset. In this paper, we introduce a Multielement Feature Guided Fragments Learning (MFGF) strategy, which leverages the cross-modal text-video representations to provide strong text-visual and text-motion matching information to tackle uncertain occlusion conflicting and variable motion details. Specifically, we establish two potential cross-modal spaces for text and video feature collaborative learning to progressively reduce the semantic difference between text and video. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed MFGF, extensive experiments have been conducted on TVPReid dataset. To the best of our knowledge, MFGF is the first successful attempt to use video for text-based person retrieval task and has achieved state-of-the-art performance on TVPReid dataset.

| **[Tree-Augmented Cross-Modal Encoding for Complex-Query Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.02503v1)** | 2020-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of user-generated videos on the Internet has intensified the need for text-based video retrieval systems. Traditional methods mainly favor the concept-based paradigm on retrieval with simple queries, which are usually ineffective for complex queries that carry far more complex semantics. Recently, embedding-based paradigm has emerged as a popular approach. It aims to map the queries and videos into a shared embedding space where semantically-similar texts and videos are much closer to each other. Despite its simplicity, it forgoes the exploitation of the syntactic structure of text queries, making it suboptimal to model the complex queries. To facilitate video retrieval with complex queries, we propose a Tree-augmented Cross-modal Encoding method by jointly learning the linguistic structure of queries and the temporal representation of videos. Specifically, given a complex user query, we first recursively compose a latent semantic tree to structurally describe the text query. We then design a tree-augmented query encoder to derive structure-aware query representation and a temporal attentive video encoder to model the temporal characteristics of videos. Finally, both the query and videos are mapped into a joint embedding space for matching and ranking. In this approach, we have a better understanding and modeling of the complex queries, thereby achieving a better video retrieval performance. Extensive experiments on large scale video retrieval benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted For 43rd International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR 2020)</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Context Aggregation for Video Retrieval with Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.01334v2)** | 2020-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current research focus on Content-Based Video Retrieval requires higher-level video representation describing the long-range semantic dependencies of relevant incidents, events, etc. However, existing methods commonly process the frames of a video as individual images or short clips, making the modeling of long-range semantic dependencies difficult. In this paper, we propose TCA (Temporal Context Aggregation for Video Retrieval), a video representation learning framework that incorporates long-range temporal information between frame-level features using the self-attention mechanism. To train it on video retrieval datasets, we propose a supervised contrastive learning method that performs automatic hard negative mining and utilizes the memory bank mechanism to increase the capacity of negative samples. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple video retrieval tasks, such as CC_WEB_VIDEO, FIVR-200K, and EVVE. The proposed method shows a significant performance advantage (~17% mAP on FIVR-200K) over state-of-the-art methods with video-level features, and deliver competitive results with 22x faster inference time comparing with frame-level features.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Scalable Video Anomaly Retrieval: A Synthetic Video-Text Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01466v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly retrieval aims to localize anomalous events in videos using natural language queries to facilitate public safety. However, existing datasets suffer from severe limitations: (1) data scarcity due to the long-tail nature of real-world anomalies, and (2) privacy constraints that impede large-scale collection. To address the aforementioned issues in one go, we introduce SVTA (Synthetic Video-Text Anomaly benchmark), the first large-scale dataset for cross-modal anomaly retrieval, leveraging generative models to overcome data availability challenges. Specifically, we collect and generate video descriptions via the off-the-shelf LLM (Large Language Model) covering 68 anomaly categories, e.g., throwing, stealing, and shooting. These descriptions encompass common long-tail events. We adopt these texts to guide the video generative model to produce diverse and high-quality videos. Finally, our SVTA involves 41,315 videos (1.36M frames) with paired captions, covering 30 normal activities, e.g., standing, walking, and sports, and 68 anomalous events, e.g., falling, fighting, theft, explosions, and natural disasters. We adopt three widely-used video-text retrieval baselines to comprehensively test our SVTA, revealing SVTA's challenging nature and its effectiveness in evaluating a robust cross-modal retrieval method. SVTA eliminates privacy risks associated with real-world anomaly collection while maintaining realistic scenarios. The dataset demo is available at: [https://svta-mm.github.io/SVTA.github.io/].</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Grained Instance-Level Sketch-Based Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.09461v1)** | 2020-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing sketch-analysis work studies sketches depicting static objects or scenes. In this work, we propose a novel cross-modal retrieval problem of fine-grained instance-level sketch-based video retrieval (FG-SBVR), where a sketch sequence is used as a query to retrieve a specific target video instance. Compared with sketch-based still image retrieval, and coarse-grained category-level video retrieval, this is more challenging as both visual appearance and motion need to be simultaneously matched at a fine-grained level. We contribute the first FG-SBVR dataset with rich annotations. We then introduce a novel multi-stream multi-modality deep network to perform FG-SBVR under both strong and weakly supervised settings. The key component of the network is a relation module, designed to prevent model over-fitting given scarce training data. We show that this model significantly outperforms a number of existing state-of-the-art models designed for video analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP2Video: Mastering Video-Text Retrieval via Image CLIP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.11097v1)** | 2021-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present CLIP2Video network to transfer the image-language pre-training model to video-text retrieval in an end-to-end manner. Leading approaches in the domain of video-and-language learning try to distill the spatio-temporal video features and multi-modal interaction between videos and languages from a large-scale video-text dataset. Different from them, we leverage pretrained image-language model, simplify it as a two-stage framework with co-learning of image-text and enhancing temporal relations between video frames and video-text respectively, make it able to train on comparatively small datasets. Specifically, based on the spatial semantics captured by Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model, our model involves a Temporal Difference Block to capture motions at fine temporal video frames, and a Temporal Alignment Block to re-align the tokens of video clips and phrases and enhance the multi-modal correlation. We conduct thorough ablation studies, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on major text-to-video and video-to-text retrieval benchmarks, including new records of retrieval accuracy on MSR-VTT, MSVD and VATEX.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Video Anomaly Retrieval from Video Anomaly Detection: New Benchmarks and Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.12545v2)** | 2024-02-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) has been paid increasing attention due to its potential applications, its current dominant tasks focus on online detecting anomalies% at the frame level, which can be roughly interpreted as the binary or multiple event classification. However, such a setup that builds relationships between complicated anomalous events and single labels, e.g., ``vandalism'', is superficial, since single labels are deficient to characterize anomalous events. In reality, users tend to search a specific video rather than a series of approximate videos. Therefore, retrieving anomalous events using detailed descriptions is practical and positive but few researches focus on this. In this context, we propose a novel task called Video Anomaly Retrieval (VAR), which aims to pragmatically retrieve relevant anomalous videos by cross-modalities, e.g., language descriptions and synchronous audios. Unlike the current video retrieval where videos are assumed to be temporally well-trimmed with short duration, VAR is devised to retrieve long untrimmed videos which may be partially relevant to the given query. To achieve this, we present two large-scale VAR benchmarks, UCFCrime-AR and XDViolence-AR, constructed on top of prevalent anomaly datasets. Meanwhile, we design a model called Anomaly-Led Alignment Network (ALAN) for VAR. In ALAN, we propose an anomaly-led sampling to focus on key segments in long untrimmed videos. Then, we introduce an efficient pretext task to enhance semantic associations between video-text fine-grained representations. Besides, we leverage two complementary alignments to further match cross-modal contents. Experimental results on two benchmarks reveal the challenges of VAR task and also demonstrate the advantages of our tailored method.

This paper presents the 1st place solution to the video retrieval track of the ICCV VALUE Challenge 2021.

| **[An Empirical Comparison of Video Frame Sampling Methods for Multi-Modal RAG Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03340v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous video frame sampling methodologies detailed in the literature present a significant challenge in determining the optimal video frame method for Video RAG pattern without a comparative side-by-side analysis. In this work, we investigate the trade-offs in frame sampling methods for Video & Frame Retrieval using natural language questions. We explore the balance between the quantity of sampled frames and the retrieval recall score, aiming to identify efficient video frame sampling strategies that maintain high retrieval efficacy with reduced storage and processing demands. Our study focuses on the storage and retrieval of image data (video frames) within a vector database required by Video RAG pattern, comparing the effectiveness of various frame sampling techniques. Our investigation indicates that the recall@k metric for both text-to-video and text-to-frame retrieval tasks using various methods covered as part of this work is comparable to or exceeds that of storing each frame from the video. Our findings are intended to inform the selection of frame sampling methods for practical Video RAG implementations, serving as a springboard for innovative research in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 24 figures (65 images)</p></details> |
| **[TempMe: Video Temporal Token Merging for Efficient Text-Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01156v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most text-video retrieval methods utilize the text-image pre-trained models like CLIP as a backbone. These methods process each sampled frame independently by the image encoder, resulting in high computational overhead and limiting practical deployment. Addressing this, we focus on efficient text-video retrieval by tackling two key challenges: 1. From the perspective of trainable parameters, current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods incur high inference costs; 2. From the perspective of model complexity, current token compression methods are mainly designed for images to reduce spatial redundancy but overlook temporal redundancy in consecutive frames of a video. To tackle these challenges, we propose Temporal Token Merging (TempMe), a parameter-efficient and training-inference efficient text-video retrieval architecture that minimizes trainable parameters and model complexity. Specifically, we introduce a progressive multi-granularity framework. By gradually combining neighboring clips, we reduce spatio-temporal redundancy and enhance temporal modeling across different frames, leading to improved efficiency and performance. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our TempMe. Compared to previous parameter-efficient text-video retrieval methods, TempMe achieves superior performance with just 0.50M trainable parameters. It significantly reduces output tokens by 95% and GFLOPs by 51%, while achieving a 1.8X speedup and a 4.4% R-Sum improvement. With full fine-tuning, TempMe achieves a significant 7.9% R-Sum improvement, trains 1.57X faster, and utilizes 75.2% GPU memory usage.

| **[Selective Query-guided Debiasing for Video Corpus Moment Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.08714v3)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video moment retrieval (VMR) aims to localize target moments in untrimmed videos pertinent to a given textual query. Existing retrieval systems tend to rely on retrieval bias as a shortcut and thus, fail to sufficiently learn multi-modal interactions between query and video. This retrieval bias stems from learning frequent co-occurrence patterns between query and moments, which spuriously correlate objects (e.g., a pencil) referred in the query with moments (e.g., scene of writing with a pencil) where the objects frequently appear in the video, such that they converge into biased moment predictions. Although recent debiasing methods have focused on removing this retrieval bias, we argue that these biased predictions sometimes should be preserved because there are many queries where biased predictions are rather helpful. To conjugate this retrieval bias, we propose a Selective Query-guided Debiasing network (SQuiDNet), which incorporates the following two main properties: (1) Biased Moment Retrieval that intentionally uncovers the biased moments inherent in objects of the query and (2) Selective Query-guided Debiasing that performs selective debiasing guided by the meaning of the query. Our experimental results on three moment retrieval benchmarks (i.e., TVR, ActivityNet, DiDeMo) show the effectiveness of SQuiDNet and qualitative analysis shows improved interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, Accepted in ECCV 2022</p></details> |

Video titling is intended to achieve this goal, but there is a lack of a proper benchmark. In this paper, we propose to CREATE, the first large-scale Chinese shoRt vidEo retrievAl and Title gEneration benchmark, to facilitate research and application in video titling and video retrieval in Chinese. CREATE consists of a high-quality labeled 210K dataset and two large-scale 3M/10M pre-training datasets, covering 51 categories, 50K+ tags, 537K manually annotated titles and captions, and 10M+ short videos. Based on CREATE, we propose a novel model ALWIG which combines video retrieval and video titling tasks to achieve the purpose of multi-modal ALignment WIth Generation with the help of video tags and a GPT pre-trained model. CREATE opens new directions for facilitating future research and applications on video titling and video retrieval in the field of Chinese short videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP4Clip: An Empirical Study of CLIP for End to End Video Clip Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08860v2)** | 2021-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-text retrieval plays an essential role in multi-modal research and has been widely used in many real-world web applications. The CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), an image-language pre-training model, has demonstrated the power of visual concepts learning from web collected image-text datasets. In this paper, we propose a CLIP4Clip model to transfer the knowledge of the CLIP model to video-language retrieval in an end-to-end manner. Several questions are investigated via empirical studies: 1) Whether image feature is enough for video-text retrieval? 2) How a post-pretraining on a large-scale video-text dataset based on the CLIP affect the performance? 3) What is the practical mechanism to model temporal dependency between video frames? And 4) The Hyper-parameters sensitivity of the model on video-text retrieval task. Extensive experimental results present that the CLIP4Clip model transferred from the CLIP can achieve SOTA results on various video-text retrieval datasets, including MSR-VTT, MSVC, LSMDC, ActivityNet, and DiDeMo. We release our code at https://github.com/ArrowLuo/CLIP4Clip.</p></details> |  |

To manage databases that scale to billions of videos, video-level approaches that use fixed-size embeddings are preferred due to their efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Video Region Attention Graph Networks (VRAG) that improves the state-of-the-art of video-level methods. We represent videos at a finer granularity via region-level features and encode video spatio-temporal dynamics through region-level relations. Our VRAG captures the relationships between regions based on their semantic content via self-attention and the permutation invariant aggregation of Graph Convolution. In addition, we show that the performance gap between video-level and frame-level methods can be reduced by segmenting videos into shots and using shot embeddings for video retrieval. We evaluate our VRAG over several video retrieval tasks and achieve a new state-of-the-art for video-level retrieval. Furthermore, our shot-level VRAG shows higher retrieval precision than other existing video-level methods, and closer performance to frame-level methods at faster evaluation speeds. Finally, our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-grained Text-Video Retrieval with Frozen Image Encoders](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09972v1)** | 2023-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art text-video retrieval (TVR) methods typically utilize CLIP and cosine similarity for efficient retrieval. Meanwhile, cross attention methods, which employ a transformer decoder to compute attention between each text query and all frames in a video, offer a more comprehensive interaction between text and videos. However, these methods lack important fine-grained spatial information as they directly compute attention between text and video-level tokens. To address this issue, we propose CrossTVR, a two-stage text-video retrieval architecture. In the first stage, we leverage existing TVR methods with cosine similarity network for efficient text/video candidate selection. In the second stage, we propose a novel decoupled video text cross attention module to capture fine-grained multimodal information in spatial and temporal dimensions. Additionally, we employ the frozen CLIP model strategy in fine-grained retrieval, enabling scalability to larger pre-trained vision models like ViT-G, resulting in improved retrieval performance. Experiments on text video retrieval datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed CrossTVR compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Synthetic Videos Useful? A Benchmark for Retrieval-Centric Evaluation of Synthetic Videos](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02316v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis has advanced rapidly, yet current evaluation metrics primarily capture visual quality and temporal consistency, offering limited insight into how synthetic videos perform in downstream tasks such as text-to-video retrieval (TVR). In this work, we introduce SynTVA, a new dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate the utility of synthetic videos for building retrieval models. Based on 800 diverse user queries derived from MSRVTT training split, we generate synthetic videos using state-of-the-art T2V models and annotate each video-text pair along four key semantic alignment dimensions: Object \& Scene, Action, Attribute, and Prompt Fidelity. Our evaluation framework correlates general video quality assessment (VQA) metrics with these alignment scores, and examines their predictive power for downstream TVR performance. To explore pathways of scaling up, we further develop an Auto-Evaluator to estimate alignment quality from existing metrics. Beyond benchmarking, our results show that SynTVA is a valuable asset for dataset augmentation, enabling the selection of high-utility synthetic samples that measurably improve TVR outcomes.

| **[A Proposal-based Approach for Activity Image-to-Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.10531v1)** | 2019-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Activity image-to-video retrieval task aims to retrieve videos containing the similar activity as the query image, which is a challenging task because videos generally have many background segments irrelevant to the activity. In this paper, we utilize R-C3D model to represent a video by a bag of activity proposals, which can filter out background segments to some extent. However, there are still noisy proposals in each bag. Thus, we propose an Activity Proposal-based Image-to-Video Retrieval (APIVR) approach, which incorporates multi-instance learning into cross-modal retrieval framework to address the proposal noise issue. Specifically, we propose a Graph Multi-Instance Learning (GMIL) module with graph convolutional layer, and integrate this module with classification loss, adversarial loss, and triplet loss in our cross-modal retrieval framework. Moreover, we propose geometry-aware triplet loss based on point-to-subspace distance to preserve the structural information of activity proposals. Extensive experiments on three widely-used datasets verify the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Thirty-Fourth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

This task is essential because advanced video retrieval applications should enable users to retrieve a precise moment from a large video corpus. We propose a novel CONtextual QUery-awarE Ranking~(CONQUER) model for effective moment localization and ranking. CONQUER explores query context for multi-modal fusion and representation learning in two different steps. The first step derives fusion weights for the adaptive combination of multi-modal video content. The second step performs bi-directional attention to tightly couple video and query as a single joint representation for moment localization. As query context is fully engaged in video representation learning, from feature fusion to transformation, the resulting feature is user-centered and has a larger capacity in capturing multi-modal signals specific to query. We conduct studies on two datasets, TVR for closed-world TV episodes and DiDeMo for open-world user-generated videos, to investigate the potential advantages of fusing video and query online as a joint representation for moment retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 2021 MultiMedia, code: https://github.com/houzhijian/CONQUER</p></details> |

MUVR aims to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos, tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance) and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3) Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base, Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and reranking.

In this paper, we explore unified retrieval methods using OmniEmbed, a powerful multimodal embedding model from the Tevatron 2.0 toolkit, in the context of the MAGMaR shared task. Evaluated on the comprehensive MultiVENT 2.0 dataset, OmniEmbed generates unified embeddings for text, images, audio, and video, enabling robust multimodal retrieval. By finetuning OmniEmbed with the combined multimodal data--visual frames, audio tracks, and textual descriptions provided in MultiVENT 2.0, we achieve substantial improvements in complex, multilingual video retrieval tasks. Our submission achieved the highest score on the MAGMaR shared task leaderboard among public submissions as of May 20th, 2025, highlighting the practical effectiveness of our unified multimodal retrieval approach.

| **[Text-Video Retrieval via Variational Multi-Modal Hypergraph Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03177v1)** | 2024-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-video retrieval is a challenging task that aims to identify relevant videos given textual queries. Compared to conventional textual retrieval, the main obstacle for text-video retrieval is the semantic gap between the textual nature of queries and the visual richness of video content. Previous works primarily focus on aligning the query and the video by finely aggregating word-frame matching signals. Inspired by the human cognitive process of modularly judging the relevance between text and video, the judgment needs high-order matching signal due to the consecutive and complex nature of video contents. In this paper, we propose chunk-level text-video matching, where the query chunks are extracted to describe a specific retrieval unit, and the video chunks are segmented into distinct clips from videos. We formulate the chunk-level matching as n-ary correlations modeling between words of the query and frames of the video and introduce a multi-modal hypergraph for n-ary correlation modeling. By representing textual units and video frames as nodes and using hyperedges to depict their relationships, a multi-modal hypergraph is constructed. In this way, the query and the video can be aligned in a high-order semantic space. In addition, to enhance the model's generalization ability, the extracted features are fed into a variational inference component for computation, obtaining the variational representation under the Gaussian distribution. The incorporation of hypergraphs and variational inference allows our model to capture complex, n-ary interactions among textual and visual contents. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the text-video retrieval task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Not All Pairs are Equal: Hierarchical Learning for Average-Precision-Oriented Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15566v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of online video resources has significantly promoted the development of video retrieval methods. As a standard evaluation metric for video retrieval, Average Precision (AP) assesses the overall rankings of relevant videos at the top list, making the predicted scores a reliable reference for users. However, recent video retrieval methods utilize pair-wise losses that treat all sample pairs equally, leading to an evident gap between the training objective and evaluation metric. To effectively bridge this gap, in this work, we aim to address two primary challenges: a) The current similarity measure and AP-based loss are suboptimal for video retrieval; b) The noticeable noise from frame-to-frame matching introduces ambiguity in estimating the AP loss. In response to these challenges, we propose the Hierarchical learning framework for Average-Precision-oriented Video Retrieval (HAP-VR). For the former challenge, we develop the TopK-Chamfer Similarity and QuadLinear-AP loss to measure and optimize video-level similarities in terms of AP. For the latter challenge, we suggest constraining the frame-level similarities to achieve an accurate AP loss estimation. Experimental results present that HAP-VR outperforms existing methods on several benchmark datasets, providing a feasible solution for video retrieval tasks and thus offering potential benefits for the multi-media application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning text-to-video retrieval from image captioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17498v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a protocol to study text-to-video retrieval training with unlabeled videos, where we assume (i) no access to labels for any videos, i.e., no access to the set of ground-truth captions, but (ii) access to labeled images in the form of text. Using image expert models is a realistic scenario given that annotating images is cheaper therefore scalable, in contrast to expensive video labeling schemes. Recently, zero-shot image experts such as CLIP have established a new strong baseline for video understanding tasks. In this paper, we make use of this progress and instantiate the image experts from two types of models: a text-to-image retrieval model to provide an initial backbone, and image captioning models to provide supervision signal into unlabeled videos. We show that automatically labeling video frames with image captioning allows text-to-video retrieval training. This process adapts the features to the target domain at no manual annotation cost, consequently outperforming the strong zero-shot CLIP baseline. During training, we sample captions from multiple video frames that best match the visual content, and perform a temporal pooling over frame representations by scoring frames according to their relevance to each caption. We conduct extensive ablations to provide insights and demonstrate the effectiveness of this simple framework by outperforming the CLIP zero-shot baselines on text-to-video retrieval on three standard datasets, namely ActivityNet, MSR-VTT, and MSVD.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A short version of this work appeared at CVPR 2023 Workshops.

| **[Reversed in Time: A Novel Temporal-Emphasized Benchmark for Cross-Modal Video-Text Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19178v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-modal (e.g. image-text, video-text) retrieval is an important task in information retrieval and multimodal vision-language understanding field. Temporal understanding makes video-text retrieval more challenging than image-text retrieval. However, we find that the widely used video-text benchmarks have shortcomings in comprehensively assessing abilities of models, especially in temporal understanding, causing large-scale image-text pre-trained models can already achieve comparable zero-shot performance with video-text pre-trained models. In this paper, we introduce RTime, a novel temporal-emphasized video-text retrieval dataset. We first obtain videos of actions or events with significant temporality, and then reverse these videos to create harder negative samples. We then recruit annotators to judge the significance and reversibility of candidate videos, and write captions for qualified videos. We further adopt GPT-4 to extend more captions based on human-written captions. Our RTime dataset currently consists of 21k videos with 10 captions per video, totalling about 122 hours. Based on RTime, we propose three retrieval benchmark tasks: RTime-Origin, RTime-Hard, and RTime-Binary. We further enhance the use of harder-negatives in model training, and benchmark a variety of video-text models on RTime. Extensive experiment analysis proves that RTime indeed poses new and higher challenges to video-text retrieval. We release our RTime dataset https://github.com/qyr0403/Reversed-in-Time to further advance video-text retrieval and multimodal understanding research.</p></details> | ACMMM 2024 poster |
| **[Masked Contrastive Pre-Training for Efficient Video-Text Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.00986v2)** | 2022-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple yet effective end-to-end Video-language Pre-training (VidLP) framework, Masked Contrastive Video-language Pretraining (MAC), for video-text retrieval tasks. Our MAC aims to reduce video representation's spatial and temporal redundancy in the VidLP model by a mask sampling mechanism to improve pre-training efficiency. Comparing conventional temporal sparse sampling, we propose to randomly mask a high ratio of spatial regions and only feed visible regions into the encoder as sparse spatial sampling. Similarly, we adopt the mask sampling technique for text inputs for consistency. Instead of blindly applying the mask-then-prediction paradigm from MAE, we propose a masked-then-alignment paradigm for efficient video-text alignment. The motivation is that video-text retrieval tasks rely on high-level alignment rather than low-level reconstruction, and multimodal alignment with masked modeling encourages the model to learn a robust and general multimodal representation from incomplete and unstable inputs. Coupling these designs enables efficient end-to-end pre-training: reduce FLOPs (60% off), accelerate pre-training (by 3x), and improve performance. Our MAC achieves state-of-the-art results on various video-text retrieval datasets, including MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet. Our approach is omnivorous to input modalities. With minimal modifications, we achieve competitive results on image-text retrieval tasks.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Near-duplicate video retrieval (NDVR) can cluster and filter out the redundant contents. In this paper, the proposed NDVR approach extracts the frame-level video representation based on convolutional neural network (CNN) features from fully-connected layer and aggregated intermediate convolutional layers. Unsupervised metric learning is used for similarity measurement and feature matching. An efficient re-ranking algorithm combined with k-nearest neighborhood fuses the retrieval results from two levels of features and further improves the retrieval performance.

The shared sparse space is initialized with a finite number of sparse concepts, each of which refers to a number of words. With the text data at hand, we learn and update the shared sparse space in a supervised manner using the proposed similarity and alignment losses. Moreover, to enable multi-grained alignment, we incorporate frame representations for better modeling the video modality and calculating fine-grained and coarse-grained similarities. Benefiting from the learned shared sparse space and multi-grained similarities, extensive experiments on several video-text retrieval benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of S3MA over existing methods.

| **[MM-Embed: Universal Multimodal Retrieval with Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02571v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art retrieval models typically address a straightforward search scenario, in which retrieval tasks are fixed (e.g., finding a passage to answer a specific question) and only a single modality is supported for both queries and retrieved results. This paper introduces techniques for advancing information retrieval with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), enabling a broader search scenario, termed universal multimodal retrieval, where multiple modalities and diverse retrieval tasks are accommodated. To this end, we first study fine-tuning an MLLM as a bi-encoder retriever on 10 datasets with 16 retrieval tasks. Our empirical results show that the fine-tuned MLLM retriever is capable of understanding challenging queries, composed of both text and image, but it underperforms compared to a smaller CLIP retriever in cross-modal retrieval tasks due to the modality bias exhibited by MLLMs. To address the issue, we propose modality-aware hard negative mining to mitigate the modality bias exhibited by MLLM retrievers. Second, we propose continuously fine-tuning the universal multimodal retriever to enhance its text retrieval capability while preserving multimodal retrieval capability. As a result, our model, MM-Embed, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the multimodal retrieval benchmark M-BEIR, which spans multiple domains and tasks, while also surpassing the state-of-the-art text retrieval model, NV-Embed-v1, on the MTEB retrieval benchmark. We also explore prompting the off-the-shelf MLLMs as zero-shot rerankers to refine the ranking of the candidates from the multimodal retriever. We find that, through prompt-and-reranking, MLLMs can further improve multimodal retrieval when the user queries (e.g., text-image composed queries) are more complex and challenging to understand. These findings also pave the way for advancing universal multimodal retrieval in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025.

While RAG improves response accuracy by incorporating external textual knowledge, MRAG extends this framework to include multimodal retrieval and generation, leveraging contextual information from diverse data types. This approach reduces hallucinations and enhances question-answering systems by grounding responses in factual, multimodal knowledge. Recent studies show MRAG outperforms traditional RAG, especially in scenarios requiring both visual and textual understanding. This survey reviews MRAG's essential components, datasets, evaluation methods, and limitations, providing insights into its construction and improvement. It also identifies challenges and future research directions, highlighting MRAG's potential to revolutionize multimodal information retrieval and generation. By offering a comprehensive perspective, this work encourages further exploration into this promising paradigm.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Multimodal Composite Editing and Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05405v2)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the real world, where information is abundant and diverse across different modalities, understanding and utilizing various data types to improve retrieval systems is a key focus of research. Multimodal composite retrieval integrates diverse modalities such as text, image and audio, etc. to provide more accurate, personalized, and contextually relevant results. To facilitate a deeper understanding of this promising direction, this survey explores multimodal composite editing and retrieval in depth, covering image-text composite editing, image-text composite retrieval, and other multimodal composite retrieval. In this survey, we systematically organize the application scenarios, methods, benchmarks, experiments, and future directions. Multimodal learning is a hot topic in large model era, and have also witnessed some surveys in multimodal learning and vision-language models with transformers published in the PAMI journal. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first comprehensive review of the literature on multimodal composite retrieval, which is a timely complement of multimodal fusion to existing reviews. To help readers' quickly track this field, we build the project page for this survey, which can be found at https://github.com/fuxianghuang1/Multimodal-Composite-Editing-and-Retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 3 figures, and 11 tables</p></details> |

This extension requires models to process and relate information from multiple modalities. In Information Retrieval, traditional retrieval tasks focus on the similarity between unimodal documents and queries, while image-text retrieval hypothesizes that most texts contain the scene context from images. This separation has ignored that real-world queries may involve text content, image captions, or both. To address this, we introduce Multimodal Retrieval on Representation of ImaGe witH Text (Mr. Right), a novel and comprehensive dataset for multimodal retrieval. We utilize the Wikipedia dataset with rich text-image examples and generate three types of text-based queries with different modality information: text-related, image-related, and mixed. To validate the effectiveness of our dataset, we provide a multimodal training paradigm and evaluate previous text retrieval and image retrieval frameworks. The results show that proposed multimodal retrieval can improve retrieval performance, but creating a well-unified document representation with texts and images is still a challenge. We hope Mr. Right allows us to broaden current retrieval systems better and contributes to accelerating the advancement of multimodal learning in the Information Retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset available at https://github.com/hsiehjackson/Mr.Right</p></details> |
| **[M3Retrieve: Benchmarking Multimodal Retrieval for Medicine](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06888v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing use of RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG), strong retrieval models have become more important than ever. In healthcare, multimodal retrieval models that combine information from both text and images offer major advantages for many downstream tasks such as question answering, cross-modal retrieval, and multimodal summarization, since medical data often includes both formats. However, there is currently no standard benchmark to evaluate how well these models perform in medical settings. To address this gap, we introduce M3Retrieve, a Multimodal Medical Retrieval Benchmark. M3Retrieve, spans 5 domains,16 medical fields, and 4 distinct tasks, with over 1.2 Million text documents and 164K multimodal queries, all collected under approved licenses. We evaluate leading multimodal retrieval models on this benchmark to explore the challenges specific to different medical specialities and to understand their impact on retrieval performance. By releasing M3Retrieve, we aim to enable systematic evaluation, foster model innovation, and accelerate research toward building more capable and reliable multimodal retrieval systems for medical applications. The dataset and the baselines code are available in this github page https://github.com/AkashGhosh/M3Retrieve.</p></details> | EMNLP Mains 2025 |

However, how to model the representation of trajectory-level data presents a significant challenge that has not been systematically addressed amid explosive trajectory data growth. In this work, we introduce Multimodal Trajectory Retrieval, bridging the gap between universal retrieval and agent-centric trajectory modeling. We construct the Unified Agent Trajectory Dataset (UATD) from annotated demonstrations and states across diverse real-world scenarios. Based on this, we present GAE-Bench, a benchmark containing a large number of trajectory-based retrieval pairs. In addition, we propose GAE-Retriever, a multimodal retrieval framework that adopts vision-language models and incorporates optimized contrastive learning through a token selection and the GradCache mechanism. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple datasets show that GAE-Retriever consistently outperforms strong baselines in retrieval recall, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing multimodal trajectory retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 3 figures, accepted by Workshop on Computer-use Agents @ ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Self-adaptive Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.11321v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods are limited by their reliance on a fixed number of retrieved documents, often resulting in incomplete or noisy information that undermines task performance. Although recent adaptive approaches alleviated these problems, their application in intricate and real-world multimodal tasks remains limited. To address these, we propose a new approach called Self-adaptive Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SAM-RAG), tailored specifically for multimodal contexts. SAM-RAG not only dynamically filters relevant documents based on the input query, including image captions when needed, but also verifies the quality of both the retrieved documents and the output. Extensive experimental results show that SAM-RAG surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in both retrieval accuracy and response generation. By further ablation experiments and effectiveness analysis, SAM-RAG maintains high recall quality while improving overall task performance in multimodal RAG task.

| **[MMDocIR: Benchmarking Multimodal Retrieval for Long Documents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08828v3)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal document retrieval aims to identify and retrieve various forms of multimodal content, such as figures, tables, charts, and layout information from extensive documents. Despite its increasing popularity, there is a notable lack of a comprehensive and robust benchmark to effectively evaluate the performance of systems in such tasks. To address this gap, this work introduces a new benchmark, named MMDocIR, that encompasses two distinct tasks: page-level and layout-level retrieval. The former evaluates the performance of identifying the most relevant pages within a long document, while the later assesses the ability of detecting specific layouts, providing a more fine-grained measure than whole-page analysis. A layout refers to a variety of elements, including textual paragraphs, equations, figures, tables, or charts. The MMDocIR benchmark comprises a rich dataset featuring 1,685 questions annotated by experts and 173,843 questions with bootstrapped labels, making it a valuable resource in multimodal document retrieval for both training and evaluation. Through rigorous experiments, we demonstrate that (i) visual retrievers significantly outperform their text counterparts, (ii) MMDocIR training set effectively enhances the performance of multimodal document retrieval and (iii) text retrievers leveraging VLM-text significantly outperforms retrievers relying on OCR-text.

| **[Multimodal semantic retrieval for product search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07365v3)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic retrieval (also known as dense retrieval) based on textual data has been extensively studied for both web search and product search application fields, where the relevance of a query and a potential target document is computed by their dense vector representation comparison. Product image is crucial for e-commerce search interactions and is a key factor for customers at product explorations. However, its impact on semantic retrieval has not been well studied yet. In this research, we build a multimodal representation for product items in e-commerce search in contrast to pure-text representation of products, and investigate the impact of such representations. The models are developed and evaluated on e-commerce datasets. We demonstrate that a multimodal representation scheme for a product can show improvement either on purchase recall or relevance accuracy in semantic retrieval. Additionally, we provide numerical analysis for exclusive matches retrieved by a multimodal semantic retrieval model versus a text-only semantic retrieval model, to demonstrate the validation of multimodal solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EReL@MIR WWW 2025</p></details> |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.12561v2)** | 2023-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent multimodal models such as DALL-E and CM3 have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-image and image-to-text generation. However, these models store all learned knowledge (e.g., the appearance of the Eiffel Tower) in the model parameters, requiring increasingly larger models and training data to capture more knowledge. To integrate knowledge in a more scalable and modular way, we propose a retrieval-augmented multimodal model, which enables a base multimodal model (generator) to refer to relevant text and images fetched by a retriever from external memory (e.g., documents on the web). Specifically, for the retriever, we use a pretrained CLIP, and for the generator, we train a CM3 Transformer on the LAION dataset. Our resulting model, named Retrieval-Augmented CM3 (RA-CM3), is the first multimodal model that can retrieve and generate both text and images. We show that RA-CM3 significantly outperforms baseline multimodal models such as DALL-E and CM3 on both image and caption generation tasks (12 FID and 17 CIDEr improvements on MS-COCO), while requiring much less compute for training (<30% of DALL-E). Moreover, we show that RA-CM3 exhibits novel capabilities, such as faithful image generation and multimodal in-context learning (e.g., image generation from demonstrations).</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICML 2023.

| **[Probabilistic Compositional Embeddings for Multimodal Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.05845v1)** | 2022-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing works in image retrieval often consider retrieving images with one or two query inputs, which do not generalize to multiple queries. In this work, we investigate a more challenging scenario for composing multiple multimodal queries in image retrieval. Given an arbitrary number of query images and (or) texts, our goal is to retrieve target images containing the semantic concepts specified in multiple multimodal queries. To learn an informative embedding that can flexibly encode the semantics of various queries, we propose a novel multimodal probabilistic composer (MPC). Specifically, we model input images and texts as probabilistic embeddings, which can be further composed by a probabilistic composition rule to facilitate image retrieval with multiple multimodal queries. We propose a new benchmark based on the MS-COCO dataset and evaluate our model on various setups that compose multiple images and (or) text queries for multimodal image retrieval. Without bells and whistles, we show that our probabilistic model formulation significantly outperforms existing related methods on multimodal image retrieval while generalizing well to query with different amounts of inputs given in arbitrary visual and (or) textual modalities.

To approach such different information-seeking demands, we introduce UniIR, a unified instruction-guided multimodal retriever capable of handling eight distinct retrieval tasks across modalities. UniIR, a single retrieval system jointly trained on ten diverse multimodal-IR datasets, interprets user instructions to execute various retrieval tasks, demonstrating robust performance across existing datasets and zero-shot generalization to new tasks. Our experiments highlight that multi-task training and instruction tuning are keys to UniIR's generalization ability.

| **[MuRAR: A Simple and Effective Multimodal Retrieval and Answer Refinement Framework for Multimodal Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08521v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have demonstrated impressive performance in the question-answering (QA) task. However, most previous works predominantly focus on text-based answers. While some studies address multimodal data, they still fall short in generating comprehensive multimodal answers, particularly for explaining concepts or providing step-by-step tutorials on how to accomplish specific goals. This capability is especially valuable for applications such as enterprise chatbots and settings such as customer service and educational systems, where the answers are sourced from multimodal data. In this paper, we introduce a simple and effective framework named MuRAR (Multimodal Retrieval and Answer Refinement). MuRAR enhances text-based answers by retrieving relevant multimodal data and refining the responses to create coherent multimodal answers. This framework can be easily extended to support multimodal answers in enterprise chatbots with minimal modifications. Human evaluation results indicate that multimodal answers generated by MuRAR are more useful and readable compared to plain text answers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at COLING 2025</p></details> |
| **[Progressive Multimodal Reasoning via Active Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14835v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-step multimodal reasoning tasks pose significant challenges for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and finding effective ways to enhance their performance in such scenarios remains an unresolved issue. In this paper, we propose AR-MCTS, a universal framework designed to progressively improve the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs through Active Retrieval (AR) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Our approach begins with the development of a unified retrieval module that retrieves key supporting insights for solving complex reasoning problems from a hybrid-modal retrieval corpus. To bridge the gap in automated multimodal reasoning verification, we employ the MCTS algorithm combined with an active retrieval mechanism, which enables the automatic generation of step-wise annotations. This strategy dynamically retrieves key insights for each reasoning step, moving beyond traditional beam search sampling to improve the diversity and reliability of the reasoning space. Additionally, we introduce a process reward model that aligns progressively to support the automatic verification of multimodal reasoning tasks. Experimental results across three complex multimodal reasoning benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of the AR-MCTS framework in enhancing the performance of various multimodal models. Further analysis demonstrates that AR-MCTS can optimize sampling diversity and accuracy, yielding reliable multimodal reasoning.</p></details> | Working in progress |
| **[Generalized Contrastive Learning for Universal Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25638v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their consistent performance improvements, cross-modal retrieval models (e.g., CLIP) show degraded performances with retrieving keys composed of fused image-text modality (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text). To address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation. Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP) using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, current retrieval methods primarily focus on surface-level similarities of textual or visual cues in trajectories, neglecting their effectiveness for the specific task at hand. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, MLLM As ReTriever (MART), which enhances the performance of embodied agents by utilizing interaction data to fine-tune an MLLM retriever based on preference learning, such that the retriever fully considers the effectiveness of trajectories and prioritizes them for unseen tasks. We also introduce Trajectory Abstraction, a mechanism that leverages MLLMs' summarization capabilities to represent trajectories with fewer tokens while preserving key information, enabling agents to better comprehend milestones in the trajectory. Experimental results across various environments demonstrate our method significantly improves task success rates in unseen scenes compared to baseline methods. This work presents a new paradigm for multimodal retrieval in embodied agents, by fine-tuning a general-purpose MLLM as the retriever to assess trajectory effectiveness. All the code for benchmark tasks, simulator modifications, and the MLLM retriever is available at https://github.com/PKU-RL/MART.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, generated reports often suffer from serious factual inaccuracy. In this paper, we introduce a fact-aware multimodal retrieval-augmented pipeline in generating accurate radiology reports (FactMM-RAG). We first leverage RadGraph to mine factual report pairs, then integrate factual knowledge to train a universal multimodal retriever. Given a radiology image, our retriever can identify high-quality reference reports to augment multimodal foundation models, thus enhancing the factual completeness and correctness of report generation. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our multimodal retriever outperforms state-of-the-art retrievers on both language generation and radiology-specific metrics, up to 6.5% and 2% score in F1CheXbert and F1RadGraph. Further analysis indicates that employing our factually-informed training strategy imposes an effective supervision signal, without relying on explicit diagnostic label guidance, and successfully propagates fact-aware capabilities from the multimodal retriever to the multimodal foundation model in radiology report generation.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 main |

These perceptual modalities support retrieval tasks, such as place recognition in robotics. However, current multimodal retrieval systems encounter difficulties when parts of the data are missing due to sensor failures or inaccessibility, such as silent videos or LiDAR scans lacking RGB information. We propose Any2Any-a novel retrieval framework that addresses scenarios where both query and reference instances have incomplete modalities. Unlike previous methods limited to the imputation of two modalities, Any2Any handles any number of modalities without training generative models. It calculates pairwise similarities with cross-modal encoders and employs a two-stage calibration process with conformal prediction to align the similarities. Any2Any enables effective retrieval across multimodal datasets, e.g., text-LiDAR and text-time series. It achieves a Recall@5 of 35% on the KITTI dataset, which is on par with baseline models with complete modalities.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents. In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets.

Previous work has attempted to adopt multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to realize UMR using only text data. However, our preliminary experiments demonstrate that more diverse multimodal training data can further unlock the potential of MLLMs. Despite its effectiveness, the existing multimodal training data is highly imbalanced in terms of modality, which motivates us to develop a training data synthesis pipeline and construct a large-scale, high-quality fused-modal training dataset. Based on the synthetic training data, we develop the General Multimodal Embedder (GME), an MLLM-based dense retriever designed for UMR. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive UMR Benchmark (UMRB) to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing UMR methods.

However, current methods either condense queries and candidates into a single vector, potentially limiting the expressiveness for fine-grained information, or produce too many vectors that are prohibitively expensive for multi-vector retrieval. In this work, we introduce MetaEmbed, a new framework for multimodal retrieval that rethinks how multimodal embeddings are constructed and interacted with at scale. During training, a fixed number of learnable Meta Tokens are appended to the input sequence. At test-time, their last-layer contextualized representations serve as compact yet expressive multi-vector embeddings. Through the proposed Matryoshka Multi-Vector Retrieval training, MetaEmbed learns to organize information by granularity across multiple vectors. As a result, we enable test-time scaling in multimodal retrieval, where users can balance retrieval quality against efficiency demands by selecting the number of tokens used for indexing and retrieval interactions. Extensive evaluations on the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (MMEB) and the Visual Document Retrieval Benchmark (ViDoRe) confirm that MetaEmbed achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance while scaling robustly to models with 32B parameters.</p></details> |  |

We explore the application of LSR to the multi-modal domain, with a focus on text-image retrieval. While LSR has seen success in text retrieval, its application in multimodal retrieval remains underexplored. Current approaches like LexLIP and STAIR require complex multi-step training on massive datasets. Our proposed approach efficiently transforms dense vectors from a frozen dense model into sparse lexical vectors. We address issues of high dimension co-activation and semantic deviation through a new training algorithm, using Bernoulli random variables to control query expansion. Experiments with two dense models (BLIP, ALBEF) and two datasets (MSCOCO, Flickr30k) show that our proposed algorithm effectively reduces co-activation and semantic deviation. Our best-performing sparsified model outperforms state-of-the-art text-image LSR models with a shorter training time and lower GPU memory requirements. Our approach offers an effective solution for training LSR retrieval models in multimodal settings.

The effectiveness of Vision-language RAG systems hinges on multimodal retrieval, which is inherently challenging due to the diverse modalities and knowledge granularities in both queries and knowledge bases. Existing methods have not fully tapped into the potential interplay between these elements. We propose a multimodal RAG system featuring a coarse-to-fine, multi-step retrieval that harmonizes multiple granularities and modalities to enhance efficacy. Our system begins with a broad initial search aligning knowledge granularity for cross-modal retrieval, followed by a multimodal fusion reranking to capture the nuanced multimodal information for top entity selection. A text reranker then filters out the most relevant fine-grained section for augmented generation. Extensive experiments on the InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA benchmarks show our method achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance and highly competitive answering results, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing KB-VQA systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence generated content, particularly in technologies like large language models for text generation and diffusion models for visual generation, have sparked widespread research interest in applying these multimodal models in the fashion domain. However, tasks involving embeddings, such as image-to-text or text-to-image retrieval, have been largely overlooked from this perspective due to the diverse nature of the multimodal fashion domain. And current research on multi-task single models lack focus on image generation. In this work, we present UniFashion, a unified framework that simultaneously tackles the challenges of multimodal generation and retrieval tasks within the fashion domain, integrating image generation with retrieval tasks and text generation tasks. UniFashion unifies embedding and generative tasks by integrating a diffusion model and LLM, enabling controllable and high-fidelity generation. Our model significantly outperforms previous single-task state-of-the-art models across diverse fashion tasks, and can be readily adapted to manage complex vision-language tasks. This work demonstrates the potential learning synergy between multimodal generation and retrieval, offering a promising direction for future research in the fashion domain.

However, existing RAG methods primarily focus on generating text-only answers, even in Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) scenarios, where multimodal elements are retrieved to assist in generating text answers. To address this, we introduce the Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Generation (MRAMG) task, in which we aim to generate multimodal answers that combine both text and images, fully leveraging the multimodal data within a corpus. Despite growing attention to this challenging task, a notable lack of a comprehensive benchmark persists for effectively evaluating its performance. To bridge this gap, we provide MRAMG-Bench, a meticulously curated, human-annotated benchmark comprising 4,346 documents, 14,190 images, and 4,800 QA pairs, distributed across six distinct datasets and spanning three domains: Web, Academia, and Lifestyle. The datasets incorporate diverse difficulty levels and complex multi-image scenarios, providing a robust foundation for evaluating the MRAMG task. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, MRAMG-Bench incorporates a comprehensive suite of both statistical and LLM-based metrics, enabling a thorough analysis of the performance of generative models in the MRAMG task. Additionally, we propose an efficient and flexible multimodal answer generation framework that can leverage LLMs/MLLMs to generate multimodal responses. Our datasets and complete evaluation results for 11 popular generative models are available at https://github.com/MRAMG-Bench/MRAMG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at SIGIR 2025; 11 pages</p></details> |

Retrieval systems typically treat these modalities as independent retrieval sources, which can lead to noisy and subpar retrieval. We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where relevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple modalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must dynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the query. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that jointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text, and metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal backbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic modality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training data for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale synthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in various languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we propose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard contrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality usage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation strategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade performance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities. In contrast, CLaMR consistently outperforms existing retrievers: on MultiVENT 2.0++, CLaMR improves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over the best single-modality retriever and by 35.4 over the best multi-modality retriever. We illustrate CLaMR's downstream utility on long-video QA, retrieving relevant frames and obtaining a 3.50% boost over LanguageBind on Video-MME and 1.42% over dense sampling on LongVideoBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages.

In this paper, we first present our efforts in building the first Multimodal Corpus for Languages in Taiwan (MultiMoco). Based on the corpus, we conduct a case study investigating the Lexical Retrieval Hypothesis (LRH), specifically examining whether the hand gestures co-occurring with speech constants facilitate lexical retrieval or serve other discourse functions. With detailed annotations on eight parliamentary interpellations in Taiwan Mandarin, we explore the co-occurrence between speech constants and non-verbal features (i.e., head movement, face movement, hand gesture, and function of hand gesture). Our findings suggest that while hand gestures do serve as facilitators for lexical retrieval in some cases, they also serve the purpose of information emphasis. This study highlights the potential of the MultiMoco Corpus to provide an important resource for in-depth analysis and further research in multimodal communication studies.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, real-world applications often demand both multimodal inputs and multimodal outputs for effective communication and grounded reasoning. Motivated by the recent success of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in complex reasoning tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs), we adopt RL as a principled and effective paradigm to address the multi-step, outcome-driven challenges inherent in multimodal output generation. Here, we introduce M2IO-R1, a novel framework for Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Generation (MRAMG) that supports both multimodal inputs and outputs. Central to our framework is an RL-based inserter, Inserter-R1-3B, trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization to guide image selection and placement in a controllable and semantically aligned manner. Empirical results show that our lightweight 3B inserter achieves strong reasoning capabilities with significantly reduced latency, outperforming baselines in both quality and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, current multimodal retrieval tasks lack sufficient complexity and demonstrate limited practical application value. It spires us to design Instance-Driven Multimodal Image Retrieval (IDMR), a novel task that requires models to retrieve images containing the same instance as a query image while matching a text-described scenario. Unlike existing retrieval tasks focused on global image similarity or category-level matching, IDMR demands fine-grained instance-level consistency across diverse contexts. To benchmark this capability, we develop IDMR-bench using real-world object tracking and first-person video data. Addressing the scarcity of training data, we propose a cross-domain synthesis method that creates 557K training samples by cropping objects from standard detection datasets. Our Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based retrieval model, trained on 1.2M samples, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both traditional benchmarks and our zero-shot IDMR-bench. Experimental results demonstrate previous models' limitations in instance-aware retrieval and highlight the potential of MLLM for advanced retrieval applications.

However, existing methods for multimodal document retrieval often replicate techniques developed for text-only retrieval, whether in how they encode documents, define training objectives, or compute similarity scores. To address these limitations, we present ColMate, a document retrieval model that bridges the gap between multimodal representation learning and document retrieval. ColMate utilizes a novel OCR-based pretraining objective, a self-supervised masked contrastive learning objective, and a late interaction scoring mechanism more relevant to multimodal document structures and visual characteristics. ColMate obtains 3.61% improvements over existing retrieval models on the ViDoRe V2 benchmark, demonstrating stronger generalization to out-of-domain benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, in wireless multi-agent scenarios, limited bandwidth poses significant challenges to exchanging semantically rich multimodal information efficiently. Traditional semantic communication methods, though effective, struggle with redundancy and loss of crucial details. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Semantic Communication (RAMSemCom) framework. RAMSemCom incorporates iterative, retrieval-driven semantic refinement tailored for distributed multi-agent environments, enabling efficient exchange of critical multimodal elements through local caching and selective transmission. Our approach dynamically optimizes retrieval using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to balance semantic fidelity with bandwidth constraints. A comprehensive case study on multi-agent autonomous driving demonstrates that our DRL-based retrieval strategy significantly improves task completion efficiency and reduces communication overhead compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

They often directly fuse the two modalities for cross-reference during the alignment to understand multimodal queries. However, existing methods often overlook crucial visual information due to a text-dominant issue, which overly depends on text-driven signals. In this paper, we introduce MIRe, a retrieval framework that achieves modality interaction without fusing textual features during the alignment. Our method allows the textual query to attend to visual embeddings while not feeding text-driven signals back into the visual representations. Additionally, we construct a pre-training dataset for multimodal query retrieval by transforming concise question-answer pairs into extended passages. Our experiments demonstrate that our pre-training strategy significantly enhances the understanding of multimodal queries, resulting in strong performance across four multimodal retrieval benchmarks under zero-shot settings. Moreover, our ablation studies and analyses explicitly verify the effectiveness of our framework in mitigating the text-dominant issue.

| **[Open Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Factual Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22521v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in generating photorealistic and prompt-aligned images, but they often produce outputs that contradict verifiable knowledge, especially when prompts involve fine-grained attributes or time-sensitive events. Conventional retrieval-augmented approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing external information, yet they are fundamentally incapable of grounding generation in accurate and evolving knowledge due to their reliance on static sources and shallow evidence integration. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORIG, an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework for Factual Image Generation (FIG), a new task that requires both visual realism and factual grounding. ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence from the web and incrementally integrates the refined knowledge into enriched prompts to guide generation. To support systematic evaluation, we build FIG-Eval, a benchmark spanning ten categories across perceptual, compositional, and temporal dimensions. Experiments demonstrate that ORIG substantially improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines, highlighting the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image generation.</p></details> | Preprint |

In this paper, we present a simple and efficient method for correcting errors in trained contrastive image-text retrieval models with no additional training, called Nearest Neighbor Normalization (NNN). We show an improvement on retrieval metrics in both text retrieval and image retrieval for all of the contrastive models that we tested (CLIP, BLIP, ALBEF, SigLIP, BEiT) and for both of the datasets that we used (MS-COCO and Flickr30k). NNN requires a reference database, but does not require any training on this database, and can even increase the retrieval accuracy of a model after finetuning.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods predominately rely on task-specific fine-tuning of vision-language models, often those trained with image-text contrastive learning. In this paper, we explore the possibility of re-purposing generative Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for retrieval. This approach enables unifying all retrieval tasks under the same formulation and, more importantly, allows for extrapolation towards unseen retrieval tasks without additional training. Our contributions can be summarised in the following aspects: (i) We introduce LamRA, a versatile framework designed to empower LMMs with sophisticated retrieval and reranking capabilities. (ii) For retrieval, we adopt a two-stage training strategy comprising language-only pre-training and multimodal instruction tuning to progressively enhance LMM's retrieval performance. (iii) For reranking, we employ joint training for both pointwise and listwise reranking, offering two distinct ways to further boost the retrieval performance. (iv) Extensive experimental results underscore the efficacy of our method in handling more than ten retrieval tasks, demonstrating robust performance in both supervised and zero-shot settings, including scenarios involving previously unseen retrieval tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Who is in the Spotlight: The Hidden Bias Undermining Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11063v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become essential in knowledge-intensive and open-domain tasks. As retrieval complexity increases, ensuring the robustness of these systems is critical. However, current RAG models are highly sensitive to the order in which evidence is presented, often resulting in unstable performance and biased reasoning, particularly as the number of retrieved items or modality diversity grows. This raises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect multimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive study of position bias in multimodal RAG systems. Through controlled experiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy curve with respect to evidence position. To quantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and develop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across decoder layers. Our results reveal that multimodal interactions intensify position bias compared to unimodal settings, and that this bias increases logarithmically with retrieval range. These findings offer both theoretical and empirical foundations for position-aware analysis in RAG, highlighting the need for evidence reordering or debiasing strategies to build more reliable and equitable generation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Music Generation with Explicit Bridges and Retrieval Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09428v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal music generation aims to produce music from diverse input modalities, including text, videos, and images. Existing methods use a common embedding space for multimodal fusion. Despite their effectiveness in other modalities, their application in multimodal music generation faces challenges of data scarcity, weak cross-modal alignment, and limited controllability. This paper addresses these issues by using explicit bridges of text and music for multimodal alignment. We introduce a novel method named Visuals Music Bridge (VMB). Specifically, a Multimodal Music Description Model converts visual inputs into detailed textual descriptions to provide the text bridge; a Dual-track Music Retrieval module that combines broad and targeted retrieval strategies to provide the music bridge and enable user control. Finally, we design an Explicitly Conditioned Music Generation framework to generate music based on the two bridges. We conduct experiments on video-to-music, image-to-music, text-to-music, and controllable music generation tasks, along with experiments on controllability. The results demonstrate that VMB significantly enhances music quality, modality, and customization alignment compared to previous methods. VMB sets a new standard for interpretable and expressive multimodal music generation with applications in various multimedia fields. Demos and code are available at https://github.com/wbs2788/VMB.</p></details> |  |

Yet, these models frequently fall short in interpreting cultural nuances effectively. Prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in enhancing cultural understanding in text-only settings, while its application in multimodal scenarios remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAVENEA (Retrieval-Augmented Visual culturE uNdErstAnding), a new benchmark designed to advance visual culture understanding through retrieval, focusing on two tasks: culture-focused visual question answering (cVQA) and culture-informed image captioning (cIC). RAVENEA extends existing datasets by integrating over 10,000 Wikipedia documents curated and ranked by human annotators. With RAVENEA, we train and evaluate seven multimodal retrievers for each image query, and measure the downstream impact of retrieval-augmented inputs across fourteen state-of-the-art VLMs. Our results show that lightweight VLMs, when augmented with culture-aware retrieval, outperform their non-augmented counterparts (by at least 3.2% absolute on cVQA and 6.2% absolute on cIC). This highlights the value of retrieval-augmented methods and culturally inclusive benchmarks for multimodal understanding.</p></details> |  |

We propose a SynthTriplet GAN framework which resolves this task by expanding the multimodal query with a synthetically generated image that captures semantic information from both image and text input. We introduce a novel triplet mining method that uses a synthetic image as an anchor to directly optimize for embedding distances of generated and target images. We demonstrate that apart from the added value of retrieval illustration with synthetic image with the focus on customization and user feedback, the proposed method greatly surpasses other multimodal generation methods and achieves state of the art results in the multimodal retrieval task. We also show that in contrast to other retrieval methods, our method provides explainable embeddings.</p></details> | Major edits |
| **[Learning Decorrelated Hashing Codes for Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00682v2)** | 2019-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In social networks, heterogeneous multimedia data correlate to each other, such as videos and their corresponding tags in YouTube and image-text pairs in Facebook. Nearest neighbor retrieval across multiple modalities on large data sets becomes a hot yet challenging problem. Hashing is expected to be an efficient solution, since it represents data as binary codes. As the bit-wise XOR operations can be fast handled, the retrieval time is greatly reduced. Few existing multimodal hashing methods consider the correlation among hashing bits. The correlation has negative impact on hashing codes. When the hashing code length becomes longer, the retrieval performance improvement becomes slower. In this paper, we propose a minimum correlation regularization (MCR) for multimodal hashing. First, the sigmoid function is used to embed the data matrices. Then, the MCR is applied on the output of sigmoid function. As the output of sigmoid function approximates a binary code matrix, the proposed MCR can efficiently decorrelate the hashing codes. Experiments show the superiority of the proposed method becomes greater as the code length increases.</p></details> |  |

Despite the success of separate-encoder approaches like CLIP align modality-specific embeddings with contrastive learning, recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable a unified encoder that directly processes composed inputs. While flexible and advanced, we identify that unified encoders trained with conventional contrastive learning are prone to learn modality shortcut, leading to poor robustness under distribution shifts. We propose a modality composition awareness framework to mitigate this issue. Concretely, a preference loss enforces multimodal embeddings to outperform their unimodal counterparts, while a composition regularization objective aligns multimodal embeddings with prototypes composed from its unimodal parts. These objectives explicitly model structural relationships between the composed representation and its unimodal counterparts. Experiments on various benchmarks show gains in out-of-distribution retrieval, highlighting modality composition awareness as a effective principle for robust composed multimodal retrieval when utilizing MLLMs as the unified encoder.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks remain limited in modality coverage and format diversity, often focusing on single- or limited-modality tasks, or coarse-grained scene understanding. To address these gaps, we introduce CFVBench, a large-scale, manually verified benchmark constructed from 599 publicly available videos, yielding 5,360 open-ended QA pairs. CFVBench spans high-density formats and domains such as chart-heavy reports, news broadcasts, and software tutorials, requiring models to retrieve and reason over long temporal video spans while maintaining fine-grained multimodal information. Using CFVBench, we systematically evaluate 7 retrieval methods and 14 widely-used MLLMs, revealing a critical bottleneck: current models (even GPT5 or Gemini) struggle to capture transient yet essential fine-grained multimodal details. To mitigate this, we propose Adaptive Visual Refinement (AVR), a simple yet effective framework that adaptively increases frame sampling density and selectively invokes external tools when necessary. Experiments show that AVR consistently enhances fine-grained multimodal comprehension and improves performance across all evaluated MLLMs</p></details> |  |

Hence, automatic music tagging has been actively explored, mostly as a classification task, which has an inherent limitation: a fixed vocabulary. On the other hand, metric learning enables flexible vocabularies by using pretrained word embeddings as side information. Also, metric learning has already proven its suitability for cross-modal retrieval tasks in other domains (e.g., text-to-image) by jointly learning a multimodal embedding space. In this paper, we investigate three ideas to successfully introduce multimodal metric learning for tag-based music retrieval: elaborate triplet sampling, acoustic and cultural music information, and domain-specific word embeddings. Our experimental results show that the proposed ideas enhance the retrieval system quantitatively, and qualitatively. Furthermore, we release the MSD500, a subset of the Million Song Dataset (MSD) containing 500 cleaned tags, 7 manually annotated tag categories, and user taste profiles.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, submitted to ICASSP 2021</p></details> |

To this end, we consider five feature types for image and text and compare the performance of the retrieval system using different combinations. Experimental results show that retrieval results can be improved when considering both visual and textual information. In addition, it is observed that among textual features entity overlap outperforms word embeddings, while geolocation embeddings achieve better performance among visual features in the retrieval task.</p></details> | <details><summary>CLEOP...</summary><p>CLEOPATRA Workshop co-located with ESWC 2020</p></details> |

Web and Social Media platforms provide a virtually unlimited amount of this multimodal data. In this work we propose to exploit this free available data to learn a multimodal image and text embedding, aiming to leverage the semantic knowledge learnt in the text domain and transfer it to a visual model for semantic image retrieval. We demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can learn from images with associated textwithout supervision and analyze the semantic structure of the learnt joint image and text embedding space. We perform a thorough analysis and performance comparison of five different state of the art text embeddings in three different benchmarks. We show that the embeddings learnt with Web and Social Media data have competitive performances over supervised methods in the text based image retrieval task, and we clearly outperform state of the art in the MIRFlickr dataset when training in the target data.

| **[Embedding Arithmetic of Multimodal Queries for Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.03162v2)** | 2022-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent text representations exhibit geometric regularities, such as the famous analogy: queen is to king what woman is to man. Such structured semantic relations were not demonstrated on image representations. Recent works aiming at bridging this semantic gap embed images and text into a multimodal space, enabling the transfer of text-defined transformations to the image modality. We introduce the SIMAT dataset to evaluate the task of Image Retrieval with Multimodal queries. SIMAT contains 6k images and 18k textual transformation queries that aim at either replacing scene elements or changing pairwise relationships between scene elements. The goal is to retrieve an image consistent with the (source image, text transformation) query. We use an image/text matching oracle (OSCAR) to assess whether the image transformation is successful. The SIMAT dataset will be publicly available. We use SIMAT to evaluate the geometric properties of multimodal embedding spaces trained with an image/text matching objective, like CLIP. We show that vanilla CLIP embeddings are not very well suited to transform images with delta vectors, but that a simple finetuning on the COCO dataset can bring dramatic improvements. We also study whether it is beneficial to leverage pretrained universal sentence encoders (FastText, LASER and LaBSE).</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at O-DRUM (CVPR workshop 2022)</p></details> |

Such documents often combine text, images, tables, equations, and graphs, each contributing unique information. In this work, we present a Modality-Aware Hybrid retrieval Architecture (MAHA), designed specifically for multimodal question answering with reasoning through a modality-aware knowledge graph. MAHA integrates dense vector retrieval with structured graph traversal, where the knowledge graph encodes cross-modal semantics and relationships. This design enables both semantically rich and context-aware retrieval across diverse modalities. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that MAHA substantially outperforms baseline methods, achieving a ROUGE-L score of 0.486, providing complete modality coverage. These results highlight MAHA's ability to combine embeddings with explicit document structure, enabling effective multimodal retrieval. Our work establishes a scalable and interpretable retrieval framework that advances RAG systems by enabling modality-aware reasoning over unstructured multimodal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, submitted for review</p></details> |

However, existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval strategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of retrieved information, leading to three critical challenges: determining when to retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved information effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce Windsock, a query-dependent module making decisions on retrieval necessity and modality selection, effectively reducing computational overhead and improving response quality. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction Tuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize retrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we adopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert question-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the generation quality by 17.07% while reducing 8.95% retrieval times.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 UniReps Workshop</p></details> |

Although the application of RAG with language-only models has been extensively explored, its adaptation into multimodal vision-language models remains nascent. Going beyond mere answer generation, the primary goal of multimodal RAG is to cultivate the models' ability to reason in response to relevant queries. To this end, we introduce a novel multimodal RAG framework named RMR (Retrieval Meets Reasoning). The RMR framework employs a bi-modal retrieval module to identify the most relevant question-answer pairs, which then serve as scaffolds for the multimodal reasoning process. This training-free approach not only encourages the model to engage deeply with the reasoning processes inherent in the retrieved content but also facilitates the generation of answers that are precise and richly interpretable. Surprisingly, utilizing solely the ScienceQA dataset, collected from elementary and high school science curricula, RMR significantly boosts the performance of various vision-language models across a spectrum of benchmark datasets, including A-OKVQA, MMBench, and SEED. These outcomes highlight the substantial potential of our multimodal retrieval and reasoning mechanism to improve the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models.</p></details> | Under review |

Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

However, existing approaches often suffer from rigid retrieval strategies and under-utilization of visual information. To bridge this gap, we propose E-Agent, an agent framework featuring two key innovations: a mRAG planner trained to dynamically orchestrate multimodal tools based on contextual reasoning, and a task executor employing tool-aware execution sequencing to implement optimized mRAG workflows. E-Agent adopts a one-time mRAG planning strategy that enables efficient information retrieval while minimizing redundant tool invocations. To rigorously assess the planning capabilities of mRAG systems, we introduce the Real-World mRAG Planning (RemPlan) benchmark. This novel benchmark contains both retrieval-dependent and retrieval-independent question types, systematically annotated with essential retrieval tools required for each instance. The benchmark's explicit mRAG planning annotations and diverse question design enhance its practical relevance by simulating real-world scenarios requiring dynamic mRAG decisions. Experiments across RemPlan and three established benchmarks demonstrate E-Agent's superiority: 13% accuracy gain over state-of-the-art mRAG methods while reducing redundant searches by 37%.</p></details> |  |

Current document retrieval-augmented generation (DocRAG) methods remain limited by their text-centric approaches, frequently missing critical visual information. The field also lacks robust benchmarks for assessing multimodal evidence selection and integration. We introduce MMDocRAG, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 4,055 expert-annotated QA pairs with multi-page, cross-modal evidence chains. Our framework introduces innovative metrics for evaluating multimodal quote selection and enables answers that interleave text with relevant visual elements. Through large-scale experiments with 60 VLM/LLM models and 14 retrieval systems, we identify persistent challenges in multimodal evidence retrieval, selection, and integration.Key findings reveal advanced proprietary LVMs show superior performance than open-sourced alternatives. Also, they show moderate advantages using multimodal inputs over text-only inputs, while open-source alternatives show significant performance degradation. Notably, fine-tuned LLMs achieve substantial improvements when using detailed image descriptions. MMDocRAG establishes a rigorous testing ground and provides actionable insights for developing more robust multimodal DocVQA systems.

However, vision-language models such as CLIP are vulnerable to typographic attacks, where misleading or irrelevant text embedded in images skews model predictions. In this work, we propose a novel method that reverses the logic of typographic attacks by rendering relevant textual content (e.g., titles, descriptions) directly onto product images to perform vision-text compression, thereby strengthening image-text alignment and boosting multimodal product retrieval performance. We evaluate our method on three vertical-specific e-commerce datasets (sneakers, handbags, and trading cards) using six state-of-the-art vision foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in unimodal and multimodal retrieval accuracy across categories and model families. Our findings suggest that visually rendering product metadata is a simple yet effective enhancement for zero-shot multimodal retrieval in e-commerce applications.</p></details> |  |

MRMR contains 1,502 queries spanning 23 domains, with positive documents carefully verified by human experts. Compared to prior benchmarks, MRMR introduces three key advancements. First, it challenges retrieval systems across diverse areas of expertise, enabling fine-grained model comparison across domains. Second, queries are reasoning-intensive, with images requiring deeper interpretation such as diagnosing microscopic slides. We further introduce Contradiction Retrieval, a novel task requiring models to identify conflicting concepts. Finally, queries and documents are constructed as image-text interleaved sequences. Unlike earlier benchmarks restricted to single images or unimodal documents, MRMR offers a realistic setting with multi-image queries and mixed-modality corpus documents. We conduct an extensive evaluation of 4 categories of multimodal retrieval systems and 14 frontier models on MRMR. The text embedding model Qwen3-Embedding with LLM-generated image captions achieves the highest performance, highlighting substantial room for improving multimodal retrieval models. Although latest multimodal models such as Ops-MM-Embedding perform competitively on expert-domain queries, they fall short on reasoning-intensive tasks. We believe that MRMR paves the way for advancing multimodal retrieval in more realistic and challenging scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods primarily focus on natural images, offering limited support for other crucial visual modalities such as videos and visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce RzenEmbed, a unified framework to learn embeddings across a diverse set of modalities, including text, images, videos, and visual documents. We employ a novel two-stage training strategy to learn discriminative representations. The first stage focuses on foundational text and multimodal retrieval. In the second stage, we introduce an improved InfoNCE loss, incorporating two key enhancements. Firstly, a hardness-weighted mechanism guides the model to prioritize challenging samples by assigning them higher weights within each batch. Secondly, we implement an approach to mitigate the impact of false negatives and alleviate data noise. This strategy not only enhances the model's discriminative power but also improves its instruction-following capabilities. We further boost performance with learnable temperature parameter and model souping. RzenEmbed sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB benchmark. It not only achieves the best overall score but also outperforms all prior work on the challenging video and visual document retrieval tasks.

| **[Progressive Evidence Refinement for Open-domain Multimodal Retrieval Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09696v1)** | 2023-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained multimodal models have achieved significant success in retrieval-based question answering. However, current multimodal retrieval question-answering models face two main challenges. Firstly, utilizing compressed evidence features as input to the model results in the loss of fine-grained information within the evidence. Secondly, a gap exists between the feature extraction of evidence and the question, which hinders the model from effectively extracting critical features from the evidence based on the given question. We propose a two-stage framework for evidence retrieval and question-answering to alleviate these issues. First and foremost, we propose a progressive evidence refinement strategy for selecting crucial evidence. This strategy employs an iterative evidence retrieval approach to uncover the logical sequence among the evidence pieces. It incorporates two rounds of filtering to optimize the solution space, thus further ensuring temporal efficiency. Subsequently, we introduce a semi-supervised contrastive learning training strategy based on negative samples to expand the scope of the question domain, allowing for a more thorough exploration of latent knowledge within known samples. Finally, in order to mitigate the loss of fine-grained information, we devise a multi-turn retrieval and question-answering strategy to handle multimodal inputs. This strategy involves incorporating multimodal evidence directly into the model as part of the historical dialogue and question. Meanwhile, we leverage a cross-modal attention mechanism to capture the underlying connections between the evidence and the question, and the answer is generated through a decoding generation approach. We validate the model's effectiveness through extensive experiments, achieving outstanding performance on WebQA and MultimodelQA benchmark tests.</p></details> |  |

Recently, researchers have shed light on the multimodality of responses as well as dialogue contexts. This work explores how a dialogue system can output responses in various modalities such as text and image. To this end, we first formulate a multimodal dialogue response retrieval task for retrieval-based systems as the combination of three subtasks. We then propose three integration methods based on a two-step approach and an end-to-end approach, and compare the merits and demerits of each method. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that the end-to-end approach achieves comparable performance without an intermediate step in the two-step approach. In addition, a parameter sharing strategy not only reduces the number of parameters but also boosts performance by transferring knowledge across the subtasks and the modalities.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |

Although recent advances have improved overall performance, they often encounter difficulties in educational settings where accurate semantic alignment and task-specific document retrieval are essential. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to multimodal textbook question answering by introducing a mechanism for enhancing semantic representations through multi-objective joint training. Our model, Joint Embedding Training With Ranking Supervision for Textbook Question Answering (JETRTQA), is a multimodal learning framework built on a retriever--generator architecture that uses a retrieval-augmented generation setup, in which a multimodal large language model generates answers. JETRTQA is designed to improve the relevance of retrieved documents in complex educational contexts. Unlike traditional direct scoring approaches, JETRTQA learns to refine the semantic representations of questions and documents through a supervised signal that combines pairwise ranking and implicit supervision derived from answers. We evaluate our method on the CK12-QA dataset and demonstrate that it significantly improves the discrimination between informative and irrelevant documents, even when they are long, complex, and multimodal. JETRTQA outperforms the previous state of the art, achieving a 2.4\% gain in accuracy on the validation set and 11.1\% on the test set.</p></details> | 14 pages, 16 figure |

This effectiveness, however, hinges on the appropriate selection of in-context examples, a process that is currently biased towards visual data, overlooking textual information. Furthermore, the area of supervised retrievers for MLLMs, crucial for optimal in-context example selection, continues to be uninvestigated. Our study offers an in-depth evaluation of the impact of textual information on the unsupervised selection of in-context examples in multimodal contexts, uncovering a notable sensitivity of retriever performance to the employed modalities. Responding to this, we introduce a novel supervised MLLM-retriever MSIER that employs a neural network to select examples that enhance multimodal in-context learning efficiency. This approach is validated through extensive testing across three distinct tasks, demonstrating the method's effectiveness. Additionally, we investigate the influence of modalities on our supervised retrieval method's training and pinpoint factors contributing to our model's success. This exploration paves the way for future advancements, highlighting the potential for refined in-context learning in MLLMs through the strategic use of multimodal data.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 |

MLLMs involve significant external knowledge within their parameters; however, it is challenging to continually update these models with the latest knowledge, which involves huge computational costs and poor interpretability. Retrieval augmentation techniques have proven to be effective plugins for both LLMs and MLLMs. In this study, we propose multimodal adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training (RA-BLIP), a novel retrieval-augmented framework for various MLLMs. Considering the redundant information within vision modality, we first leverage the question to instruct the extraction of visual information through interactions with one set of learnable queries, minimizing irrelevant interference during retrieval and generation. Besides, we introduce a pre-trained multimodal adaptive fusion module to achieve question text-to-multimodal retrieval and integration of multimodal knowledge by projecting visual and language modalities into a unified semantic space. Furthermore, we present an Adaptive Selection Knowledge Generation (ASKG) strategy to train the generator to autonomously discern the relevance of retrieved knowledge, which realizes excellent denoising performance. Extensive experiments on open multimodal question-answering datasets demonstrate that RA-BLIP achieves significant performance and surpasses the state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, Journal</p></details> |
| **[Simple but Effective Raw-Data Level Multimodal Fusion for Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15875v1)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed image retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve the target image based on a multimodal query, i.e., a reference image paired with corresponding modification text. Recent CIR studies leverage vision-language pre-trained (VLP) methods as the feature extraction backbone, and perform nonlinear feature-level multimodal query fusion to retrieve the target image. Despite the promising performance, we argue that their nonlinear feature-level multimodal fusion may lead to the fused feature deviating from the original embedding space, potentially hurting the retrieval performance. To address this issue, in this work, we propose shifting the multimodal fusion from the feature level to the raw-data level to fully exploit the VLP model's multimodal encoding and cross-modal alignment abilities. In particular, we introduce a Dual Query Unification-based Composed Image Retrieval framework (DQU-CIR), whose backbone simply involves a VLP model's image encoder and a text encoder. Specifically, DQU-CIR first employs two training-free query unification components: text-oriented query unification and vision-oriented query unification, to derive a unified textual and visual query based on the raw data of the multimodal query, respectively. The unified textual query is derived by concatenating the modification text with the extracted reference image's textual description, while the unified visual query is created by writing the key modification words onto the reference image. Ultimately, to address diverse search intentions, DQU-CIR linearly combines the features of the two unified queries encoded by the VLP model to retrieve the target image. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | ACM SIGIR 2024 |

Conventional vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search, Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding.

To support queries across content modalities, the system should enable cross-modal correlation and computation-efficient indexing. While hashing methods have shown great potential in achieving this goal, current attempts generally fail to learn isomorphic hash codes in a seamless scheme, that is, they embed multiple modalities in a continuous isomorphic space and separately threshold embeddings into binary codes, which incurs substantial loss of retrieval accuracy. In this paper, we approach seamless multimodal hashing by proposing a novel Composite Correlation Quantization (CCQ) model. Specifically, CCQ jointly finds correlation-maximal mappings that transform different modalities into isomorphic latent space, and learns composite quantizers that convert the isomorphic latent features into compact binary codes. An optimization framework is devised to preserve both intra-modal similarity and inter-modal correlation through minimizing both reconstruction and quantization errors, which can be trained from both paired and partially paired data in linear time. A comprehensive set of experiments clearly show the superior effectiveness and efficiency of CCQ against the state of the art hashing methods for both unimodal and cross-modal retrieval.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce MegaPairs, a novel data synthesis method that leverages vision language models (VLMs) and open-domain images, together with a massive synthetic dataset generated from this method. Our empirical analysis shows that MegaPairs generates high-quality data, enabling the multimodal retriever to significantly outperform the baseline model trained on 70$\times$ more data from existing datasets. Moreover, since MegaPairs solely relies on general image corpora and open-source VLMs, it can be easily scaled up, enabling continuous improvements in retrieval performance. In this stage, we produced more than 26 million training instances and trained several models of varying sizes using this data. These new models achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across 4 popular composed image retrieval (CIR) benchmarks and the highest overall performance on the 36 datasets provided by MMEB. They also demonstrate notable performance improvements with additional downstream fine-tuning.

To support high-quality retrieval for these cutting-edge applications, a robust multimodal data retrieval platform should meet the challenges of transparent data storage, rich hybrid queries, effective feature representation, and high query efficiency. However, among the existing platforms, traditional schema-on-write systems, multi-model databases, vector databases, and data lakes, which are the primary options for multimodal data retrieval, make it difficult to fulfill these challenges simultaneously. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a more versatile multimodal data retrieval platform to address these issues. In this paper, we introduce a Multimodal Data Retrieval Platform with Query-aware Feature Representation and Learned Index based on Data Lake (MQRLD). It leverages the transparent storage capabilities of data lakes, integrates the multimodal open API to provide a unified interface that supports rich hybrid queries, introduces a query-aware multimodal data feature representation strategy to obtain effective features, and offers high-dimensional learned indexes to optimize data query. We conduct a comparative analysis of the query performance of MQRLD against other methods for rich hybrid queries. Our results underscore the superior efficiency of MQRLD in handling multimodal data retrieval tasks, demonstrating its potential to significantly improve retrieval performance in complex environments. We also clarify some potential concerns in the discussion.</p></details> | 34 pages, 28 figures |

However, their ability to represent multimodal information in the acoustic domain remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Vela, a novel framework designed to adapt MLLMs for the generation of universal multimodal embeddings. By leveraging MLLMs with specially crafted prompts and selected in-context learning examples, Vela effectively bridges the modality gap across various modalities. We then propose a single-modality training approach, where the model is trained exclusively on text pairs. Our experiments show that Vela outperforms traditional CLAP models in standard text-audio retrieval tasks. Furthermore, we introduce new benchmarks that expose CLAP models' limitations in handling long texts and complex retrieval tasks. In contrast, Vela, by harnessing the capabilities of MLLMs, demonstrates robust performance in these scenarios.

| **[Benchmarking Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation with Dynamic VQA Dataset and Self-adaptive Planning Agent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02937v5)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (mRAG) plays an important role in mitigating the "hallucination" issue inherent in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Although promising, existing heuristic mRAGs typically predefined fixed retrieval processes, which causes two issues: (1) Non-adaptive Retrieval Queries. (2) Overloaded Retrieval Queries. However, these flaws cannot be adequately reflected by current knowledge-seeking visual question answering (VQA) datasets, since the most required knowledge can be readily obtained with a standard two-step retrieval. To bridge the dataset gap, we first construct Dyn-VQA dataset, consisting of three types of "dynamic" questions, which require complex knowledge retrieval strategies variable in query, tool, and time: (1) Questions with rapidly changing answers. (2) Questions requiring multi-modal knowledge. (3) Multi-hop questions. Experiments on Dyn-VQA reveal that existing heuristic mRAGs struggle to provide sufficient and precisely relevant knowledge for dynamic questions due to their rigid retrieval processes. Hence, we further propose the first self-adaptive planning agent for multimodal retrieval, OmniSearch. The underlying idea is to emulate the human behavior in question solution which dynamically decomposes complex multimodal questions into sub-question chains with retrieval action. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of our OmniSearch, also provide direction for advancing mRAG. The code and dataset will be open-sourced at https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/OmniSearch.</p></details> |  |

These models have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks of multimodal information retrieval (MIR), including web search, cross-modal retrieval, and recommender systems, etc. However, due to their enormous parameter sizes, significant efficiency challenges emerge across training, deployment, and inference stages when adapting these models' representation for IR tasks. These challenges present substantial obstacles to the practical adaptation of foundation models for representation learning in information retrieval tasks. To address these pressing issues, we propose organizing the first EReL@MIR workshop at the Web Conference 2025, inviting participants to explore novel solutions, emerging problems, challenges, efficiency evaluation metrics and benchmarks. This workshop aims to provide a platform for both academic and industry researchers to engage in discussions, share insights, and foster collaboration toward achieving efficient and effective representation learning for multimodal information retrieval in the era of large foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>WWW20...</summary><p>WWW2025 Workshop Summary</p></details> |
| **[MM-R5: MultiModal Reasoning-Enhanced ReRanker via Reinforcement Learning for Document Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12364v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal document retrieval systems enable information access across text, images, and layouts, benefiting various domains like document-based question answering, report analysis, and interactive content summarization. Rerankers improve retrieval precision by reordering retrieved candidates. However, current multimodal reranking methods remain underexplored, with significant room for improvement in both training strategies and overall effectiveness. Moreover, the lack of explicit reasoning makes it difficult to analyze and optimize these methods further. In this paper, We propose MM-R5, a MultiModal Reasoning-Enhanced ReRanker via Reinforcement Learning for Document Retrieval, aiming to provide a more effective and reliable solution for multimodal reranking tasks. MM-R5 is trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we focus on improving instruction-following and guiding the model to generate complete and high-quality reasoning chains. To support this, we introduce a novel data construction strategy that produces rich, high-quality reasoning data. In the RL stage, we design a task-specific reward framework, including a reranking reward tailored for multimodal candidates and a composite template-based reward to further refine reasoning quality. We conduct extensive experiments on MMDocIR, a challenging public benchmark spanning multiple domains. MM-R5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on most metrics and delivers comparable results to much larger models on the remaining ones. Moreover, compared to the best retrieval-only method, MM-R5 improves recall@1 by over 4%. These results validate the effectiveness of our reasoning-enhanced training pipeline. Our code is available at https://github.com/i2vec/MM-R5 .</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Prompt Retrieval for Generative Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.17675v1)** | 2023-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed impressive results of pre-trained vision-language models on knowledge-intensive tasks such as visual question answering (VQA). Despite the recent advances in VQA, existing methods mainly adopt a discriminative formulation that predicts answers within a pre-defined label set, leading to easy overfitting on low-resource domains with limited labeled data (e.g., medicine) and poor generalization under domain shift to another dataset. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel generative model enhanced by multimodal prompt retrieval (MPR) that integrates retrieved prompts and multimodal features to generate answers in free text. Our generative model enables rapid zero-shot dataset adaptation to unseen data distributions and open-set answer labels across datasets. Our experiments on medical VQA tasks show that MPR outperforms its non-retrieval counterpart by up to 30% accuracy points in a few-shot domain adaptation setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guided Query Refinement: Multimodal Hybrid Retrieval with Test-Time Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05038v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal encoders have pushed the boundaries of visual document retrieval, matching textual query tokens directly to image patches and achieving state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks. Recent models relying on this paradigm have massively scaled the sizes of their query and document representations, presenting obstacles to deployment and scalability in real-world pipelines. Furthermore, purely vision-centric approaches may be constrained by the inherent modality gap still exhibited by modern vision-language models. In this work, we connect these challenges to the paradigm of hybrid retrieval, investigating whether a lightweight dense text retriever can enhance a stronger vision-centric model. Existing hybrid methods, which rely on coarse-grained fusion of ranks or scores, fail to exploit the rich interactions within each model's representation space. To address this, we introduce Guided Query Refinement (GQR), a novel test-time optimization method that refines a primary retriever's query embedding using guidance from a complementary retriever's scores. Through extensive experiments on visual document retrieval benchmarks, we demonstrate that GQR allows vision-centric models to match the performance of models with significantly larger representations, while being up to 14x faster and requiring 54x less memory. Our findings show that GQR effectively pushes the Pareto frontier for performance and efficiency in multimodal retrieval. We release our code at https://github.com/IBM/test-time-hybrid-retrieval</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-shot Multimodal Document Retrieval via Cross-modal Question Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17079v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have expanded information retrieval beyond purely textual inputs, enabling retrieval from complex real world documents that combine text and visuals. However, most documents are private either owned by individuals or confined within corporate silos and current retrievers struggle when faced with unseen domains or languages. To address this gap, we introduce PREMIR, a simple yet effective framework that leverages the broad knowledge of an MLLM to generate cross modal pre questions (preQs) before retrieval. Unlike earlier multimodal retrievers that compare embeddings in a single vector space, PREMIR leverages preQs from multiple complementary modalities to expand the scope of matching to the token level. Experiments show that PREMIR achieves state of the art performance on out of distribution benchmarks, including closed domain and multilingual settings, outperforming strong baselines across all retrieval metrics. We confirm the contribution of each component through in depth ablation studies, and qualitative analyses of the generated preQs further highlight the model's robustness in real world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAP: Retrieval-Augmented Personalization for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13360v3)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as general assistants. However, lack of user-specific knowledge still restricts their application in human's daily life. In this paper, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Personalization (RAP) framework for MLLMs' personalization. Starting from a general MLLM, we turn it into a personalized assistant in three steps. (a) Remember: We design a key-value database to store user-related information, e.g., user's name, avatar and other attributes. (b) Retrieve: When the user initiates a conversation, RAP will retrieve relevant information from the database using a multimodal retriever. (c) Generate: The input query and retrieved concepts' information are fed into MLLMs to generate personalized, knowledge-augmented responses. Unlike previous methods, RAP allows real-time concept editing via updating the external database. To further improve generation quality and alignment with user-specific information, we design a pipeline for data collection and create a specialized dataset for personalized training of MLLMs. Based on the dataset, we train a series of MLLMs as personalized multimodal assistants. By pretraining on large-scale dataset, RAP-MLLMs can generalize to infinite visual concepts without additional finetuning. Our models demonstrate outstanding flexibility and generation quality across a variety of tasks, such as personalized image captioning, question answering and visual recognition. The code, data and models are available at https://hoar012.github.io/RAP-Project/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025.

However, existing MRAG frameworks primarily adhere to rigid, single-step retrieval strategies that fail to address real-world challenges of information acquisition and query reformulation. In this work, we introduce the task of Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation Planning (MRAG Planning) that aims at effective information seeking and integration while minimizing computational overhead. Specifically, we propose CogPlanner, an agentic plug-and-play framework inspired by human cognitive processes, which iteratively determines query reformulation and retrieval strategies to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses. CogPlanner supports parallel and sequential modeling paradigms. Furthermore, we introduce CogBench, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the MRAG Planning task and facilitate lightweight CogPlanner integration with resource-efficient MLLMs, such as Qwen2-VL-7B-Cog. Experimental results demonstrate that CogPlanner significantly outperforms existing MRAG baselines, offering improvements in both accuracy and efficiency with minimal additional computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR-AP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Hypothetical Summary for Retrieval-based Multi-image Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14880v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-based multi-image question answering (QA) task involves retrieving multiple question-related images and synthesizing these images to generate an answer. Conventional "retrieve-then-answer" pipelines often suffer from cascading errors because the training objective of QA fails to optimize the retrieval stage. To address this issue, we propose a novel method to effectively introduce and reference retrieved information into the QA. Given the image set to be retrieved, we employ a multimodal large language model (visual perspective) and a large language model (textual perspective) to obtain multimodal hypothetical summary in question-form and description-form. By combining visual and textual perspectives, MHyS captures image content more specifically and replaces real images in retrieval, which eliminates the modality gap by transforming into text-to-text retrieval and helps improve retrieval. To more advantageously introduce retrieval with QA, we employ contrastive learning to align queries (questions) with MHyS. Moreover, we propose a coarse-to-fine strategy for calculating both sentence-level and word-level similarity scores, to further enhance retrieval and filter out irrelevant details. Our approach achieves a 3.7% absolute improvement over state-of-the-art methods on RETVQA and a 14.5% improvement over CLIP. Comprehensive experiments and detailed ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[From Swath to Full-Disc: Advancing Precipitation Retrieval with Multimodal Knowledge Expansion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07050v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate near-real-time precipitation retrieval has been enhanced by satellite-based technologies. However, infrared-based algorithms have low accuracy due to weak relations with surface precipitation, whereas passive microwave and radar-based methods are more accurate but limited in range. This challenge motivates the Precipitation Retrieval Expansion (PRE) task, which aims to enable accurate, infrared-based full-disc precipitation retrievals beyond the scanning swath. We introduce Multimodal Knowledge Expansion, a two-stage pipeline with the proposed PRE-Net model. In the Swath-Distilling stage, PRE-Net transfers knowledge from a multimodal data integration model to an infrared-based model within the scanning swath via Coordinated Masking and Wavelet Enhancement (CoMWE). In the Full-Disc Adaptation stage, Self-MaskTune refines predictions across the full disc by balancing multimodal and full-disc infrared knowledge. Experiments on the introduced PRE benchmark demonstrate that PRE-Net significantly advanced precipitation retrieval performance, outperforming leading products like PERSIANN-CCS, PDIR, and IMERG. The code will be available at https://github.com/Zjut-MultimediaPlus/PRE-Net.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Scaling Strategies for Generative Retrieval in Multimodal Conversational Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18132v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of e-commerce has exposed the limitations of traditional product retrieval systems in managing complex, multi-turn user interactions. Recent advances in multimodal generative retrieval -- particularly those leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as retrievers -- have shown promise. However, most existing methods are tailored to single-turn scenarios and struggle to model the evolving intent and iterative nature of multi-turn dialogues when applied naively. Concurrently, test-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving large language model (LLM) performance through iterative inference-time refinement. Yet, its effectiveness typically relies on two conditions: (1) a well-defined problem space (e.g., mathematical reasoning), and (2) the model's ability to self-correct -- conditions that are rarely met in conversational product search. In this setting, user queries are often ambiguous and evolving, and MLLMs alone have difficulty grounding responses in a fixed product corpus. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel framework that introduces test-time scaling into conversational multimodal product retrieval. Our approach builds on a generative retriever, further augmented with a test-time reranking (TTR) mechanism that improves retrieval accuracy and better aligns results with evolving user intent throughout the dialogue. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent improvements, with average gains of 14.5 points in MRR and 10.6 points in nDCG@1.</p></details> |  |

While dense text captions can achieve 75.9% Recall@5, they require expensive offline processing and miss critical visual information present in 34% of clips with scene text not captured by ASR. By analyzing query intent and predicting information needs, ModaRoute reduces computational overhead by 41% while achieving 60.9% Recall@5. Our approach uses GPT-4.1 to route queries across ASR (speech), OCR (text), and visual indices, averaging 1.78 modalities per query versus exhaustive 3.0 modality search. Evaluation on 1.8M video clips demonstrates that intelligent routing provides a practical solution for scaling multimodal retrieval systems, reducing infrastructure costs while maintaining competitive effectiveness for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025 Multimodal Representation and Retrieval Workshop</p></details> |

Existing retrieval-augmented approaches mainly focused on modeling the retrieved textual knowledge, but this may not be able to accurately identify complex relations. To improve the prediction, this research proposes to retrieve textual and visual evidence based on the object, sentence, and whole image. We further develop a novel approach to synthesize the object-level, image-level, and sentence-level information for better reasoning between the same and different modalities. Extensive experiments and analyses show that the proposed method is able to effectively select and compare evidence across modalities and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2023 |
| **[Audio Retrieval for Multimodal Design Documents: A New Dataset and Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14757v1)** | 2023-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider and propose a new problem of retrieving audio files relevant to multimodal design document inputs comprising both textual elements and visual imagery, e.g., birthday/greeting cards. In addition to enhancing user experience, integrating audio that matches the theme/style of these inputs also helps improve the accessibility of these documents (e.g., visually impaired people can listen to the audio instead). While recent work in audio retrieval exists, these methods and datasets are targeted explicitly towards natural images. However, our problem considers multimodal design documents (created by users using creative software) substantially different from a naturally clicked photograph. To this end, our first contribution is collecting and curating a new large-scale dataset called Melodic-Design (or MELON), comprising design documents representing various styles, themes, templates, illustrations, etc., paired with music audio. Given our paired image-text-audio dataset, our next contribution is a novel multimodal cross-attention audio retrieval (MMCAR) algorithm that enables training neural networks to learn a common shared feature space across image, text, and audio dimensions. We use these learned features to demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and produce a new reference benchmark for the research community on our new dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages including references</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Representation Alignment for Cross-modal Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08774v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Different machine learning models can represent the same underlying concept in different ways. This variability is particularly valuable for in-the-wild multimodal retrieval, where the objective is to identify the corresponding representation in one modality given another modality as input. This challenge can be effectively framed as a feature alignment problem. For example, given a sentence encoded by a language model, retrieve the most semantically aligned image based on features produced by an image encoder, or vice versa. In this work, we first investigate the geometric relationships between visual and textual embeddings derived from both vision-language models and combined unimodal models. We then align these representations using four standard similarity metrics as well as two learned ones, implemented via neural networks. Our findings indicate that the Wasserstein distance can serve as an informative measure of the modality gap, while cosine similarity consistently outperforms alternative metrics in feature alignment tasks. Furthermore, we observe that conventional architectures such as multilayer perceptrons are insufficient for capturing the complex interactions between image and text representations. Our study offers novel insights and practical considerations for researchers working in multimodal information retrieval, particularly in real-world, cross-modal applications.</p></details> |  |

A large part of our system has been developed as part of TRECVideo evaluation. The MAVSIR platform provides High-level feature extraction from audio-visual content and concept/event-based video retrieval. We illustrate the architecture of the system as well as provide an overview of the descriptors supported to date. Then we demonstrate the usefulness of the toolbox in the context of feature extraction, concepts/events learning and retrieval in large collections of video surveillance dataset. The results are encouraging as we are able to get good results on several event categories, while for all events we have gained valuable insights and experience.</p></details> | 7 pages |

However, applying LLMs to the communication domain faces three major challenges: 1) Inadequate communication data; 2) Restricted input modalities; and 3) Difficulty in knowledge retrieval. To overcome these issues, we propose CommGPT, a multimodal foundation model designed specifically for communications. First, we create high-quality pretraining and fine-tuning datasets tailored in communication, enabling the LLM to engage in further pretraining and fine-tuning with communication concepts and knowledge. Then, we design a multimodal encoder to understand and process information from various input modalities. Next, we construct a Graph and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRG) framework, efficiently coupling Knowledge Graph (KG) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for multi-scale learning. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the CommGPT through experimental validation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Beyond Context: A Survey of Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Document Understanding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15253v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document understanding is critical for applications from financial analysis to scientific discovery. Current approaches, whether OCR-based pipelines feeding Large Language Models (LLMs) or native Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), face key limitations: the former loses structural detail, while the latter struggles with context modeling. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps ground models in external data, but documents' multimodal nature, i.e., combining text, tables, charts, and layout, demands a more advanced paradigm: Multimodal RAG. This approach enables holistic retrieval and reasoning across all modalities, unlocking comprehensive document intelligence. Recognizing its importance, this paper presents a systematic survey of Multimodal RAG for document understanding. We propose a taxonomy based on domain, retrieval modality, and granularity, and review advances involving graph structures and agentic frameworks. We also summarize key datasets, benchmarks, and applications, and highlight open challenges in efficiency, fine-grained representation, and robustness, providing a roadmap for future progress in document AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[ArtSeek: Deep artwork understanding via multimodal in-context reasoning and late interaction retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21917v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing digitized artworks presents unique challenges, requiring not only visual interpretation but also a deep understanding of rich artistic, contextual, and historical knowledge. We introduce ArtSeek, a multimodal framework for art analysis that combines multimodal large language models with retrieval-augmented generation. Unlike prior work, our pipeline relies only on image input, enabling applicability to artworks without links to Wikidata or Wikipedia-common in most digitized collections. ArtSeek integrates three key components: an intelligent multimodal retrieval module based on late interaction retrieval, a contrastive multitask classification network for predicting artist, genre, style, media, and tags, and an agentic reasoning strategy enabled through in-context examples for complex visual question answering and artwork explanation via Qwen2.5-VL. Central to this approach is WikiFragments, a Wikipedia-scale dataset of image-text fragments curated to support knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including a +8.4% F1 improvement in style classification over GraphCLIP and a +7.1 BLEU@1 gain in captioning on ArtPedia. Qualitative analyses show that ArtSeek can interpret visual motifs, infer historical context, and retrieve relevant knowledge, even for obscure works. Though focused on visual arts, our approach generalizes to other domains requiring external knowledge, supporting scalable multimodal AI research. Both the dataset and the source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/cilabuniba/artseek.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by integrating external dynamic information for improved factual grounding. With advances in multimodal learning, Multimodal RAG extends this approach by incorporating multiple modalities such as text, images, audio, and video to enhance the generated outputs. However, cross-modal alignment and reasoning introduce unique challenges beyond those in unimodal RAG. This survey offers a structured and comprehensive analysis of Multimodal RAG systems, covering datasets, benchmarks, metrics, evaluation, methodologies, and innovations in retrieval, fusion, augmentation, and generation. We review training strategies, robustness enhancements, loss functions, and agent-based approaches, while also exploring the diverse Multimodal RAG scenarios. In addition, we outline open challenges and future directions to guide research in this evolving field.

Existing methods typically rely solely on the input audio as a unimodal retrieval query. In contrast, we propose Generation-Assisted Multimodal Querying, which generates a text description of the input audio to enable multimodal querying. This approach aligns the query modality with the audio-text structure of the knowledge base, leading to more effective retrieval. Furthermore, we introduce a novel progressive learning strategy that gradually increases the number of interleaved audio-text pairs to enhance the training process. Our experiments on AudioCaps, Clotho, and Auto-ACD demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across these benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing MMKGs are generally limited in scope: they are often constructed by augmenting pre-existing knowledge graphs, which restricts their knowledge, resulting in outdated or incomplete knowledge coverage, and they often support only a narrow range of modalities, such as text and visual information. These limitations restrict applicability to multimodal tasks, particularly as recent MLLMs adopt richer modalities like video and audio. Therefore, we propose the Visual-Audio-Text Knowledge Graph (VAT-KG), the first concept-centric and knowledge-intensive multimodal knowledge graph that covers visual, audio, and text information, where each triplet is linked to multimodal data and enriched with detailed descriptions of concepts. Specifically, our construction pipeline ensures cross-modal knowledge alignment between multimodal data and fine-grained semantics through a series of stringent filtering and alignment steps, enabling the automatic generation of MMKGs from any multimodal dataset. We further introduce a novel multimodal RAG framework that retrieves detailed concept-level knowledge in response to queries from arbitrary modalities. Experiments on question answering tasks across various modalities demonstrate the effectiveness of VAT-KG in supporting MLLMs, highlighting its practical value in unifying and leveraging multimodal knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://vatkg.github.io/</p></details> |

While pooling reduces the annotation effort, it results in only partially labeled datasets. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative to reducing reliance on manual judgments, particularly in complex domains like medical case-based retrieval, where relevance assessment requires analyzing both textual and visual information. In this work, we explore using a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to expand relevance judgments, creating a new dataset of automated judgments. Specifically, we employ Gemini 1.5 Pro on the ImageCLEFmed 2013 case-based retrieval task, simulating human assessment through an iteratively refined, structured prompting strategy that integrates binary scoring, instruction-based evaluation, and few-shot learning. We systematically experimented with various prompt configurations to maximize agreement with human judgments. To evaluate agreement between the MLLM and human judgments, we use Cohen's Kappa, achieving a substantial agreement score of 0.6, comparable to inter-annotator agreement typically observed in multimodal retrieval tasks. Starting from the original 15,028 manual judgments (4.72% relevant) across 35 topics, our MLLM-based approach expanded the dataset by over 37x to 558,653 judgments, increasing relevant annotations to 5,950. On average, each medical case query received 15,398 new annotations, with approximately 99% being non-relevant, reflecting the high sparsity typical in this domain. Our results demonstrate the potential of MLLMs to scale relevance judgment collection, offering a promising direction for supporting retrieval evaluation in medical and multimodal IR tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the Third Workshop on Large Language Models for Evaluation in Information Retrieval (LLM4Eval 2025), co-located with SIGIR 2025. 9 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

In this article, we propose a novel deep semantic multimodal hashing network (DSMHN) for scalable image-text and video-text retrieval. The proposed deep hashing framework leverages 2-D convolutional neural networks (CNN) as the backbone network to capture the spatial information for image-text retrieval, while the 3-D CNN as the backbone network to capture the spatial and temporal information for video-text retrieval. In the DSMHN, two sets of modality-specific hash functions are jointly learned by explicitly preserving both intermodality similarities and intramodality semantic labels. Specifically, with the assumption that the learned hash codes should be optimal for the classification task, two stream networks are jointly trained to learn the hash functions by embedding the semantic labels on the resultant hash codes. Moreover, a unified deep multimodal hashing framework is proposed to learn compact and high-quality hash codes by exploiting the feature representation learning, intermodality similarity-preserving learning, semantic label-preserving learning, and hash function learning with different types of loss functions simultaneously. The proposed DSMHN method is a generic and scalable deep hashing framework for both image-text and video-text retrievals, which can be flexibly integrated with different types of loss functions. We conduct extensive experiments for both single modal- and cross-modal-retrieval tasks on four widely used multimodal-retrieval data sets. Experimental results on both image-text- and video-text-retrieval tasks demonstrate that the DSMHN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Given a depression-related text, our method retrieves semantically relevant emotional content from a sentiment dataset and uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate an Emotion Prompt as an auxiliary modality. This prompt enriches emotional representation and improves interpretability.

However, there lacks a unified perception of at which stage and how to incorporate different modalities. In this survey, we review methods that assist and augment generative models by retrieving multimodal knowledge, whose formats range from images, codes, tables, graphs, to audio. Such methods offer a promising solution to important concerns such as factuality, reasoning, interpretability, and robustness. By providing an in-depth review, this survey is expected to provide scholars with a deeper understanding of the methods' applications and encourage them to adapt existing techniques to the fast-growing field of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Telling the What while Pointing to the Where: Multimodal Queries for Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04980v3)** | 2021-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing image retrieval systems use text queries as a way for the user to express what they are looking for. However, fine-grained image retrieval often requires the ability to also express where in the image the content they are looking for is. The text modality can only cumbersomely express such localization preferences, whereas pointing is a more natural fit. In this paper, we propose an image retrieval setup with a new form of multimodal queries, where the user simultaneously uses both spoken natural language (the what) and mouse traces over an empty canvas (the where) to express the characteristics of the desired target image. We then describe simple modifications to an existing image retrieval model, enabling it to operate in this setup. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our model effectively takes this spatial guidance into account, and provides significantly more accurate retrieval results compared to text-only equivalent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV 2021)</p></details> |
| **[CLASP: Contrastive Language-Speech Pretraining for Multilingual Multimodal Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13071v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces CLASP (Contrastive Language-Speech Pretraining), a multilingual, multimodal representation tailored for audio-text information retrieval. CLASP leverages the synergy between spoken content and textual data. During training, we utilize our newly introduced speech-text dataset, which encompasses 15 diverse categories ranging from fiction to religion. CLASP's audio component integrates audio spectrograms with a pre-trained self-supervised speech model, while its language encoding counterpart employs a sentence encoder pre-trained on over 100 languages. This unified lightweight model bridges the gap between various modalities and languages, enhancing its effectiveness in handling and retrieving multilingual and multimodal data. Our evaluations across multiple languages demonstrate that CLASP establishes new benchmarks in HITS@1, MRR, and meanR metrics, outperforming traditional ASR-based retrieval methods that rely on transcribing speech into text for subsequent text retrieval, especially in specific scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ECIR 2025, 13 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[MR$^2$-Bench: Going Beyond Matching to Reasoning in Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.26378v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval is becoming a crucial component of modern AI applications, yet its evaluation lags behind the demands of more realistic and challenging scenarios. Existing benchmarks primarily probe surface-level semantic correspondence (e.g., object-text matching) while failing to assess the deeper reasoning required to capture complex relationships between visual and textual information. To address this gap, we introduce MR$^2$-Bench, a reasoning-intensive benchmark for multimodal retrieval. MR$^2$-Bench presents the following critical values: 1) all tasks are reasoning-driven, going beyond shallow matching to effectively assess models' capacity for logical, spatial, and causal inference; 2) it features diverse multimodal data, such as natural images, diagrams, and visual puzzles, enabling comprehensive evaluation across content types; 3) it supports complex queries and documents containing multiple images and covers diverse retrieval scenarios, more accurately reflecting real-world applications. Our benchmark contains 1,309 curated queries, derived either from manual collection and annotation or from selective consolidation of public datasets. Despite achieving strong results on existing benchmarks, current state-of-the-art models still struggle on MR$^2$-Bench: for example, the leading Seed1.6-Embedding model attains a Recall@1 of 77.78 on MMEB, but only 9.91 on MR$^2$-Bench. This substantial performance gap highlights both the increased challenge posed by our benchmark and the pressing need for further advances in reasoning-intensive multimodal retrieval. The dataset and evaluation code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/MR2-Bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[MRAG-Bench: Vision-Centric Evaluation for Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08182v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing multimodal retrieval benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether models can retrieve and utilize external textual knowledge for question answering. However, there are scenarios where retrieving visual information is either more beneficial or easier to access than textual data. In this paper, we introduce a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation benchmark, MRAG-Bench, in which we systematically identify and categorize scenarios where visually augmented knowledge is better than textual knowledge, for instance, more images from varying viewpoints. MRAG-Bench consists of 16,130 images and 1,353 human-annotated multiple-choice questions across 9 distinct scenarios. With MRAG-Bench, we conduct an evaluation of 10 open-source and 4 proprietary large vision-language models (LVLMs). Our results show that all LVLMs exhibit greater improvements when augmented with images compared to textual knowledge, confirming that MRAG-Bench is vision-centric. Additionally, we conduct extensive analysis with MRAG-Bench, which offers valuable insights into retrieval-augmented LVLMs. Notably, the top-performing model, GPT-4o, faces challenges in effectively leveraging retrieved knowledge, achieving only a 5.82% improvement with ground-truth information, in contrast to a 33.16% improvement observed in human participants. These findings highlight the importance of MRAG-Bench in encouraging the community to enhance LVLMs' ability to utilize retrieved visual knowledge more effectively.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented VLMs for Multimodal Melanoma Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.08338v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and early diagnosis of malignant melanoma is critical for improving patient outcomes. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise in dermoscopic image analysis, they often neglect clinical metadata and require extensive preprocessing. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a multimodal alternative but struggle to capture clinical specificity when trained on general-domain data. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented VLM framework that incorporates semantically similar patient cases into the diagnostic prompt. Our method enables informed predictions without fine-tuning and significantly improves classification accuracy and error correction over conventional baselines. These results demonstrate that retrieval-augmented prompting provides a robust strategy for clinical decision support.</p></details> | <details><summary>Medic...</summary><p>Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) ISIC Skin Image Analysis Workshop (MICCAI ISIC) 2025; 10 pages</p></details> |
