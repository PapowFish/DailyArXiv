| **[Dual Learning with Dynamic Knowledge Distillation and Soft Alignment for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12283v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Almost all previous text-to-video retrieval works ideally assume that videos are pre-trimmed with short durations containing solely text-related content. However, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with much more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the given query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills generalization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language pre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR network. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic Knowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides supervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model comprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable knowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific information from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance learning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By replacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve during training, our method enables the model to better capture the fine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR. The code is available at https://github.com/HuiGuanLab/DL-DKD.</p></details> |  |
| **[TCMA: Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment for Drone Cross-Modal Text-Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10180v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become powerful platforms for real-time, high-resolution data collection, producing massive volumes of aerial videos. Efficient retrieval of relevant content from these videos is crucial for applications in urban management, emergency response, security, and disaster relief. While text-video retrieval has advanced in natural video domains, the UAV domain remains underexplored due to limitations in existing datasets, such as coarse and redundant captions. Thus, in this work, we construct the Drone Video-Text Match Dataset (DVTMD), which contains 2,864 videos and 14,320 fine-grained, semantically diverse captions. The annotations capture multiple complementary aspects, including human actions, objects, background settings, environmental conditions, and visual style, thereby enhancing text-video correspondence and reducing redundancy. Building on this dataset, we propose the Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment (TCMA) framework, which integrates global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation, and word-guided patch alignment. To further refine local alignment, we design a Word and Patch Selection module that filters irrelevant content, as well as a Text-Adaptive Dynamic Temperature Mechanism that adapts attention sharpness to text type. Extensive experiments on DVTMD and CapERA establish the first complete benchmark for drone text-video retrieval. Our TCMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, including 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8% R@1 in video-to-text retrieval, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset and method. The code and dataset will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Panorama: Fast-Track Nearest Neighbors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00566v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space, aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99\% of query time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms compact over 90\% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts, SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns. Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.</p></details> |  |
| **[TransMamba: Fast Universal Architecture Adaption from Transformers to Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15130v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based architectures have become the backbone of both uni-modal and multi-modal foundation models, largely due to their scalability via attention mechanisms, resulting in a rich ecosystem of publicly available pre-trained models such as LLaVA, CLIP, and DeiT, etc. In parallel, emerging sub-quadratic architectures like Mamba offer promising efficiency gains by enabling global context modeling with linear complexity. However, training these architectures from scratch remains resource-intensive (e.g., in terms of data and time). Motivated by this challenge, we explore a cross-architecture knowledge transfer paradigm, termed TransMamba, that facilitates the reuse of Transformer pre-trained knowledge. We propose a two-stage framework to accelerate the training of Mamba-based models, ensuring their effectiveness across both uni-modal and multi-modal tasks. The first stage leverages pre-trained Transformer models to initialize critical components of the Mamba architecture. To bridge architectural and dimensional gaps, we develop a selective weight subcloning strategy and a layered initialization scheme that prioritizes the early $n$ layers. Building on this initialization, the second stage introduces an adaptive multi-directional knowledge distillation method. This mechanism employs layer-wise adaptive scaling factors to align Mamba representations with their Transformer counterparts, while accommodating the scanning order variations inherent to multi-modal Mamba architectures. Despite operating with a reduced training dataset and a more compact model architecture, TransMamba consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse mamba-based backbones (e.g., PlainMamba, Vmamba, ViM and VideoMamba) and downstream tasks (e.g., image classification, visual question answering, text-video retrieval and multimodal reasoning). All code and implementation details will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Queries Are Not Alone: Clustering Text Embeddings for Video Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07720v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of video content across various platforms has highlighted the urgent need for advanced video retrieval systems. Traditional methods, which primarily depend on directly matching textual queries with video metadata, often fail to bridge the semantic gap between text descriptions and the multifaceted nature of video content. This paper introduces a novel framework, the Video-Text Cluster (VTC), which enhances video retrieval by clustering text queries to capture a broader semantic scope. We propose a unique clustering mechanism that groups related queries, enabling our system to consider multiple interpretations and nuances of each query. This clustering is further refined by our innovative Sweeper module, which identifies and mitigates noise within these clusters. Additionally, we introduce the Video-Text Cluster-Attention (VTC-Att) mechanism, which dynamically adjusts focus within the clusters based on the video content, ensuring that the retrieval process emphasizes the most relevant textual features. Further experiments have demonstrated that our proposed model surpasses existing state-of-the-art models on five public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval 2025</p></details> |
| **[PRVR: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12510v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In current text-to-video retrieval (T2VR), videos to be retrieved have been properly trimmed so that a correspondence between the videos and ad-hoc textual queries naturally exists. Note in practice that videos circulated on the Internet and social media platforms, while being relatively short, are typically rich in their content. Often, multiple scenes / actions / events are shown in a single video, leading to a more challenging T2VR setting wherein only part of the video content is relevant w.r.t. a given query. This paper presents a first study on this setting which we term Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR). Considering that a video typically consists of multiple moments, a video is regarded as partially relevant w.r.t. to a given query if it contains a query-related moment. We formulate the PRVR task as a multiple instance learning problem, and propose a Multi-Scale Similarity Learning (MS-SL++) network that jointly learns both clip-scale and frame-scale similarities to determine the partial relevance between video-query pairs. Extensive experiments on three diverse video-text datasets (TVshow Retrieval, ActivityNet-Captions and Charades-STA) demonstrate the viability of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI.

| **[LogSTOP: Temporal Scores over Prediction Sequences for Matching and Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06512v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural models such as YOLO and HuBERT can be used to detect local properties such as objects ("car") and emotions ("angry") in individual frames of videos and audio clips respectively. The likelihood of these detections is indicated by scores in [0, 1]. Lifting these scores to temporal properties over sequences can be useful for several downstream applications such as query matching (e.g., "does the speaker eventually sound happy in this audio clip?"), and ranked retrieval (e.g., "retrieve top 5 videos with a 10 second scene where a car is detected until a pedestrian is detected"). In this work, we formalize this problem of assigning Scores for TempOral Properties (STOPs) over sequences, given potentially noisy score predictors for local properties. We then propose a scoring function called LogSTOP that can efficiently compute these scores for temporal properties represented in Linear Temporal Logic. Empirically, LogSTOP, with YOLO and HuBERT, outperforms Large Vision / Audio Language Models and other Temporal Logic-based baselines by at least 16% on query matching with temporal properties over objects-in-videos and emotions-in-speech respectively. Similarly, on ranked retrieval with temporal properties over objects and actions in videos, LogSTOP with Grounding DINO and SlowR50 reports at least a 19% and 16% increase in mean average precision and recall over zero-shot text-to-video retrieval baselines respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Watch and Learn: Learning to Use Computers from Online Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04673v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer use agents (CUAs) need to plan task workflows grounded in diverse, ever-changing applications and environments, but learning is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data in the target application. Existing datasets are domain-specific, static, and costly to annotate, while current synthetic data generation methods often yield simplistic or misaligned task demonstrations. To address these limitations, we introduce Watch & Learn (W&L), a framework that converts human demonstration videos readily available on the Internet into executable UI trajectories at scale. Instead of directly generating trajectories or relying on ad hoc reasoning heuristics, we cast the problem as an inverse dynamics objective: predicting the user's action from consecutive screen states. This formulation reduces manual engineering, is easier to learn, and generalizes more robustly across applications. Concretely, we develop an inverse dynamics labeling pipeline with task-aware video retrieval, generate over 53k high-quality trajectories from raw web videos, and demonstrate that these trajectories improve CUAs both as in-context demonstrations and as supervised training data. On the challenging OSWorld benchmark, UI trajectories extracted with W&L consistently enhance both general-purpose and state-of-the-art frameworks in-context, and deliver stronger gains for open-source models under supervised training. These results highlight web-scale human demonstration videos as a practical and scalable foundation for advancing CUAs towards real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Keyframe Layouts for Visual Known-Item Search in Homogeneous Collections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04396v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal deep-learning models power interactive video retrieval by ranking keyframes in response to textual queries. Despite these advances, users must still browse ranked candidates manually to locate a target. Keyframe arrangement within the search grid highly affects browsing effectiveness and user efficiency, yet remains underexplored. We report a study with 49 participants evaluating seven keyframe layouts for the Visual Known-Item Search task. Beyond efficiency and accuracy, we relate browsing phenomena, such as overlooks, to layout characteristics. Our results show that a video-grouped layout is the most efficient, while a four-column, rank-preserving grid achieves the highest accuracy. Sorted grids reveal potentials and trade-offs, enabling rapid scanning of uninteresting regions but down-ranking relevant targets to less prominent positions, delaying first arrival times and increasing overlooks. These findings motivate hybrid designs that preserve positions of top-ranked items while sorting or grouping the remainder, and offer guidance for searching in grids beyond video retrieval.</p></details> | 28 Pages, 17 Figures |
| **[Omni-Embed-Nemotron: A Unified Multimodal Retrieval Model for Text, Image, Audio, and Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03458v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Omni-Embed-Nemotron, a unified multimodal retrieval embedding model developed to handle the increasing complexity of real-world information needs. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced language models by incorporating external knowledge, existing text-based retrievers rely on clean, structured input and struggle with the visually and semantically rich content found in real-world documents such as PDFs, slides, or videos. Recent work such as ColPali has shown that preserving document layout using image-based representations can improve retrieval quality. Building on this, and inspired by the capabilities of recent multimodal models such as Qwen2.5-Omni, we extend retrieval beyond text and images to also support audio and video modalities. Omni-Embed-Nemotron enables both cross-modal (e.g., text - video) and joint-modal (e.g., text - video+audio) retrieval using a single model. We describe the architecture, training setup, and evaluation results of Omni-Embed-Nemotron, and demonstrate its effectiveness in text, image, and video retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with Multi-Modal Large Language Models for Text-Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23284v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval, especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood, introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM), which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text. Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks, our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4 R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors. Code is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/BLiM.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 Highlight |
| **[X-CoT: Explainable Text-to-Video Retrieval via LLM-based Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21559v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevalent text-to-video retrieval systems mainly adopt embedding models for feature extraction and compute cosine similarities for ranking. However, this design presents two limitations. Low-quality text-video data pairs could compromise the retrieval, yet are hard to identify and examine. Cosine similarity alone provides no explanation for the ranking results, limiting the interpretability. We ask that can we interpret the ranking results, so as to assess the retrieval models and examine the text-video data? This work proposes X-CoT, an explainable retrieval framework upon LLM CoT reasoning in place of the embedding model-based similarity ranking. We first expand the existing benchmarks with additional video annotations to support semantic understanding and reduce data bias. We also devise a retrieval CoT consisting of pairwise comparison steps, yielding detailed reasoning and complete ranking. X-CoT empirically improves the retrieval performance and produces detailed rationales. It also facilitates the model behavior and data quality analysis. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/PrasannaPulakurthi/X-CoT.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures.

| **[ConViS-Bench: Estimating Video Similarity Through Semantic Concepts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19245v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>What does it mean for two videos to be similar? Videos may appear similar when judged by the actions they depict, yet entirely different if evaluated based on the locations where they were filmed. While humans naturally compare videos by taking different aspects into account, this ability has not been thoroughly studied and presents a challenge for models that often depend on broad global similarity scores. Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with video understanding capabilities open new opportunities for leveraging natural language in comparative video tasks. We introduce Concept-based Video Similarity estimation (ConViS), a novel task that compares pairs of videos by computing interpretable similarity scores across a predefined set of key semantic concepts. ConViS allows for human-like reasoning about video similarity and enables new applications such as concept-conditioned video retrieval. To support this task, we also introduce ConViS-Bench, a new benchmark comprising carefully annotated video pairs spanning multiple domains. Each pair comes with concept-level similarity scores and textual descriptions of both differences and similarities. Additionally, we benchmark several state-of-the-art models on ConViS, providing insights into their alignment with human judgments. Our results reveal significant performance differences on ConViS, indicating that some concepts present greater challenges for estimating video similarity. We believe that ConViS-Bench will serve as a valuable resource for advancing research in language-driven video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[VidCLearn: A Continual Learning Approach for Text-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16956v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video generation is an emerging field in generative AI, enabling the creation of realistic, semantically accurate videos from text prompts. While current models achieve impressive visual quality and alignment with input text, they typically rely on static knowledge, making it difficult to incorporate new data without retraining from scratch. To address this limitation, we propose VidCLearn, a continual learning framework for diffusion-based text-to-video generation. VidCLearn features a student-teacher architecture where the student model is incrementally updated with new text-video pairs, and the teacher model helps preserve previously learned knowledge through generative replay. Additionally, we introduce a novel temporal consistency loss to enhance motion smoothness and a video retrieval module to provide structural guidance at inference. Our architecture is also designed to be more computationally efficient than existing models while retaining satisfactory generation performance. Experimental results show VidCLearn's superiority over baseline methods in terms of visual quality, semantic alignment, and temporal coherence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Captioning for Text-Video Retrieval via Dual-Group Direct Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16560v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In text-video retrieval, auxiliary captions are often used to enhance video understanding, bridging the gap between the modalities. While recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot caption generation, we observe that such captions tend to be generic and indistinguishable across visually similar videos, limiting their utility for fine-grained retrieval. Moreover, conventional captioning approaches are typically evaluated using language generation metrics, such as BLEU, which are not typically tailored for retrieval tasks that require making discriminative distinctions between candidates. To address this, we propose $\textbf{CaRe-DPO}$, a retrieval framework that directly optimizes caption generation using retrieval relevance scores. At its core is Dual-Group Direct Preference Optimization (DG-DPO), a novel learning strategy that supervises captioning by modeling preferences across groups of distinct video and caption pairs. In addition, we present an MLLM-based retrieval model that incorporates role-embeddings to better distinguish between textual inputs with different functional roles, such as an auxiliary caption and a text query. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CaRe-DPO significantly enhances retrieval performance by effectively leveraging auxiliary knowledge to generate fine-grained captions for retrieval. Code is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/CaReDPO.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |
| **[AutoArabic: A Three-Stage Framework for Localizing Video-Text Retrieval Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16438v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-to-text and text-to-video retrieval are dominated by English benchmarks (e.g. DiDeMo, MSR-VTT) and recent multilingual corpora (e.g. RUDDER), yet Arabic remains underserved, lacking localized evaluation metrics. We introduce a three-stage framework, AutoArabic, utilizing state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to translate non-Arabic benchmarks into Modern Standard Arabic, reducing the manual revision required by nearly fourfold. The framework incorporates an error detection module that automatically flags potential translation errors with 97% accuracy. Applying the framework to DiDeMo, a video retrieval benchmark produces DiDeMo-AR, an Arabic variant with 40,144 fluent Arabic descriptions. An analysis of the translation errors is provided and organized into an insightful taxonomy to guide future Arabic localization efforts. We train a CLIP-style baseline with identical hyperparameters on the Arabic and English variants of the benchmark, finding a moderate performance gap (about 3 percentage points at Recall@1), indicating that Arabic localization preserves benchmark difficulty. We evaluate three post-editing budgets (zero/ flagged-only/ full) and find that performance improves monotonically with more post-editing, while the raw LLM output (zero-budget) remains usable. To ensure reproducibility to other languages, we made the code available at https://github.com/Tahaalshatiri/AutoArabic.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ArabicNLP 2025 (EMNLP 2025 workshop)</p></details> |
| **[Enhanced Partially Relevant Video Retrieval through Inter- and Intra-Sample Analysis with Coherence Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19637v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve the target video that is partially relevant to the text query. The primary challenge in PRVR arises from the semantic asymmetry between textual and visual modalities, as videos often contain substantial content irrelevant to the query. Existing methods coarsely align paired videos and text queries to construct the semantic space, neglecting the critical cross-modal dual nature inherent in this task: inter-sample correlation and intra-sample redundancy. To this end, we propose a novel PRVR framework to systematically exploit these two characteristics. Our framework consists of three core modules. First, the Inter Correlation Enhancement (ICE) module captures inter-sample correlation by identifying semantically similar yet unpaired text queries and video moments, combining them to form pseudo-positive pairs for more robust semantic space construction. Second, the Intra Redundancy Mining (IRM) module mitigates intra-sample redundancy by mining redundant moment features and distinguishing them from query-relevant moments, encouraging the model to learn more discriminative representations. Finally, to reinforce these modules, we introduce the Temporal Coherence Prediction (TCP) module, which enhances temporal structure learning by training the model to predict the original temporal order of randomly shuffled video frames and moments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to prior methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid-Tower: Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for Text-to-Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04773v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Text-to-Video Retrieval (T2VR) task aims to retrieve unlabeled videos by textual queries with the same semantic meanings. Recent CLIP-based approaches have explored two frameworks: Two-Tower versus Single-Tower framework, yet the former suffers from low effectiveness, while the latter suffers from low efficiency. In this study, we explore a new Hybrid-Tower framework that can hybridize the advantages of the Two-Tower and Single-Tower framework, achieving high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. We propose a novel hybrid method, Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for T2VR, ie, PIG, which includes a new pseudo-query generator designed to generate a pseudo-query for each video. This enables the video feature and the textual features of pseudo-query to interact in a fine-grained manner, similar to the Single-Tower approaches to hold high effectiveness, even before the real textual query is received. Simultaneously, our method introduces no additional storage or computational overhead compared to the Two-Tower framework during the inference stage, thus maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experiments on five commonly used text-video retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a significant improvement over the baseline, with an increase of $1.6\% \sim 3.9\%$ in R@1. Furthermore, our method matches the efficiency of Two-Tower models while achieving near state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the advantages of the Hybrid-Tower framework.</p></details> | Accepted to ICCV2025 |
| **[Short-Form Video Recommendations with Multimodal Embeddings: Addressing Cold-Start and Bias Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19346v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, social media users have spent significant amounts of time on short-form video platforms. As a result, established platforms in other domains, such as e-commerce, have begun introducing short-form video content to engage users and increase their time spent on the platform. The success of these experiences is due not only to the content itself but also to a unique UI innovation: instead of offering users a list of choices to click, platforms actively recommend content for users to watch one at a time. This creates new challenges for recommender systems, especially when launching a new video experience. Beyond the limited interaction data, immersive feed experiences introduce stronger position bias due to the UI and duration bias when optimizing for watch-time, as models tend to favor shorter videos. These issues, together with the feedback loop inherent in recommender systems, make it difficult to build effective solutions. In this paper, we highlight the challenges faced when introducing a new short-form video experience and present our experience showing that, even with sufficient video interaction data, it can be more beneficial to leverage a video retrieval system using a fine-tuned multimodal vision-language model to overcome these challenges. This approach demonstrated greater effectiveness compared to conventional supervised learning methods in online experiments conducted on our e-commerce platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Partially Relevant Video Retrieval with Robust Alignment Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01383v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos partially relevant to a given query. The core challenge lies in learning robust query-video alignment against spurious semantic correlations arising from inherent data uncertainty: 1) query ambiguity, where the query incompletely characterizes the target video and often contains uninformative tokens, and 2) partial video relevance, where abundant query-irrelevant segments introduce contextual noise in cross-modal alignment. Existing methods often focus on enhancing multi-scale clip representations and retrieving the most relevant clip. However, the inherent data uncertainty in PRVR renders them vulnerable to distractor videos with spurious similarities, leading to suboptimal performance. To fill this research gap, we propose Robust Alignment Learning (RAL) framework, which explicitly models the uncertainty in data. Key innovations include: 1) we pioneer probabilistic modeling for PRVR by encoding videos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions. This not only quantifies data uncertainty but also enables proxy-level matching to capture the variability in cross-modal correspondences; 2) we consider the heterogeneous informativeness of query words and introduce learnable confidence gates to dynamically weight similarity. As a plug-and-play solution, RAL can be seamlessly integrated into the existing architectures. Extensive experiments across diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Modality Tags for Enhanced Cross-Modal Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01591v3)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video retrieval requires aligning visual content with corresponding natural language descriptions. In this paper, we introduce Modality Auxiliary Concepts for Video Retrieval (MAC-VR), a novel approach that leverages modality-specific tags -- automatically extracted from foundation models -- to enhance video retrieval. We propose to align modalities in a latent space, along with learning and aligning auxiliary latent concepts derived from the features of a video and its corresponding caption. We introduce these auxiliary concepts to improve the alignment of visual and textual latent concepts, allowing concepts to be distinguished from one another. We conduct extensive experiments on six diverse datasets: two different splits of MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, TGIF, Charades and YouCook2. The experimental results consistently demonstrate that modality-specific tags improve cross-modal alignment, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods across three datasets and performing comparably or better across others.

| **[Multi-Focused Video Group Activities Hashing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00490v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH (multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProPy: Building Interactive Prompt Pyramids upon CLIP for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19024v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events, ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels, and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous models by significant margins.

| **[Repeating Words for Video-Language Retrieval with Coarse-to-Fine Objectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14812v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The explosive growth of video streaming presents challenges in achieving high accuracy and low training costs for video-language retrieval. However, existing methods rely on large-scale pre-training to improve video retrieval performance, resulting in significant computational demands. Additionally, the fine-grained information in videos and texts remains underexplored. To alleviate these problems, we propose a novel framework to learn fine-grained features for better alignment and introduce an inference pipeline to improve performance without additional training. Specifically, we employ coarse-to-fine objectives to understand the semantic information of video-text pairs, including contrastive and matching learning. The fine-grained data used for training is obtained through the Granularity-Aware Representation module, which is designed based on similarity analysis between video frames and words in captions. Furthermore, we observe that the repetition of keywords in the original captions, referred to as "Repetition", can enhance retrieval performance and improve alignment between video and text. Based on this insight, we propose a novel and effective inference pipeline that incorporates a voting mechanism and a new Matching Entropy metric to achieve better retrieval performance without requiring additional pre-training. Experimental results on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous approaches. Additionally, our inference pipeline achieves significant performance improvements, with a 2.1% increase in Recall@1 on the MSR-VTT dataset and a 1.6% increase on the DiDeMo dataset.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Beyond Simple Edits: Composed Video Retrieval with Dense Modifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14039v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense modification text that is around seven times more than its existing counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder, enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its efficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense modification texts. Our proposed dataset, code, and model are available at :https://github.com/OmkarThawakar/BSE-CoVR</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV-2025</p></details> |
| **[VimoRAG: Video-based Retrieval-augmented 3D Motion Generation for Motion Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12081v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces VimoRAG, a novel video-based retrieval-augmented motion generation framework for motion large language models (LLMs). As motion LLMs face severe out-of-domain/out-of-vocabulary issues due to limited annotated data, VimoRAG leverages large-scale in-the-wild video databases to enhance 3D motion generation by retrieving relevant 2D human motion signals. While video-based motion RAG is nontrivial, we address two key bottlenecks: (1) developing an effective motion-centered video retrieval model that distinguishes human poses and actions, and (2) mitigating the issue of error propagation caused by suboptimal retrieval results. We design the Gemini Motion Video Retriever mechanism and the Motion-centric Dual-alignment DPO Trainer, enabling effective retrieval and generation processes. Experimental results show that VimoRAG significantly boosts the performance of motion LLMs constrained to text-only input.</p></details> | 20 pages,13 figures |
| **[TrajSV: A Trajectory-based Model for Sports Video Representations and Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11569v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sports analytics has received significant attention from both academia and industry in recent years. Despite the growing interest and efforts in this field, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2) lack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for sufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a trajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies. TrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation Network (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data preprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports broadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to learn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet learns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual features with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive loss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an unsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast video datasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e., soccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e., sports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The results demonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports video retrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement. It outperforms baselines in action spotting, achieving state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 17 action categories, and demonstrates a nearly 20% improvement in video captioning. Additionally, we introduce a deployed system along with the three applications based on TrajSV.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by TCSVT</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal LLM-based Query Paraphrasing for Video Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12341v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video retrieval answers user queries through searches based on concepts and embeddings. However, due to limitations in the size of the concept bank and the amount of training data, answering queries in the wild is not always effective because of the out-of-vocabulary problem. Furthermore, neither concept-based nor embedding-based search can perform reasoning to consolidate search results for complex queries that include logical and spatial constraints. To address these challenges, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to paraphrase queries using text-to-text (T2T), text-to-image (T2I), and image-to-text (I2T) transformations. These transformations rephrase abstract concepts into simpler terms to mitigate the out-of-vocabulary problem. Additionally, complex relationships within a query can be decomposed into simpler sub-queries, improving retrieval performance by effectively fusing the search results of these sub-queries. To mitigate the issue of LLM hallucination, this paper also proposes a novel consistency-based verification strategy to filter out factually incorrect paraphrased queries. Extensive experiments are conducted for ad-hoc video search and known-item search on the TRECVid datasets. We provide empirical insights into how traditionally difficult-to-answer queries can be effectively resolved through query paraphrasing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Video Promotion Against Text-to-Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06964v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thanks to the development of cross-modal models, text-to-video retrieval (T2VR) is advancing rapidly, but its robustness remains largely unexamined. Existing attacks against T2VR are designed to push videos away from queries, i.e., suppressing the ranks of videos, while the attacks that pull videos towards selected queries, i.e., promoting the ranks of videos, remain largely unexplored. These attacks can be more impactful as attackers may gain more views/clicks for financial benefits and widespread (mis)information. To this end, we pioneer the first attack against T2VR to promote videos adversarially, dubbed the Video Promotion attack (ViPro). We further propose Modal Refinement (MoRe) to capture the finer-grained, intricate interaction between visual and textual modalities to enhance black-box transferability. Comprehensive experiments cover 2 existing baselines, 3 leading T2VR models, 3 prevailing datasets with over 10k videos, evaluated under 3 scenarios. All experiments are conducted in a multi-target setting to reflect realistic scenarios where attackers seek to promote the video regarding multiple queries simultaneously. We also evaluated our attacks for defences and imperceptibility. Overall, ViPro surpasses other baselines by over $30/10/4\%$ for white/grey/black-box settings on average. Our work highlights an overlooked vulnerability, provides a qualitative analysis on the upper/lower bound of our attacks, and offers insights into potential counterplays. Code will be publicly available at https://github.com/michaeltian108/ViPro.</p></details> |  |
| **[GAID: Frame-Level Gated Audio-Visual Integration with Directional Perturbation for Text-Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01711v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video retrieval requires precise alignment between language and temporally rich video signals. Existing methods predominantly exploit visual cues and often overlook complementary audio semantics or adopt coarse fusion strategies, leading to suboptimal multimodal representations. We present GAID, a framework that jointly address this gap via two key components: (i) a Frame-level Gated Fusion (FGF) that adaptively integrates audio and visual features under textual guidance, enabling fine-grained temporal alignment; and (ii) a Directional Adaptive Semantic Perturbation (DASP) that injects structure-aware perturbations into text embeddings, enhancing robustness and discrimination without incurring multi-pass inference. These modules complement each other -- fusion reduces modality gaps while perturbation regularizes cross-modal matching -- yielding more stable and expressive representations. Extensive experiments on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and VATEX show consistent state-of-the-art results across all retrieval metrics with notable efficiency gains. Our code is available at https://github.com/YangBowenn/GAID.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Ghost: Investigating Ranking Bias Hidden in AI-Generated Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07327v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC), the creation of high-quality AI-generated videos has become faster and easier, resulting in the Internet being flooded with all kinds of video content. However, the impact of these videos on the content ecosystem remains largely unexplored. Video information retrieval remains a fundamental approach for accessing video content. Building on the observation that retrieval models often favor AI-generated content in ad-hoc and image retrieval tasks, we investigate whether similar biases emerge in the context of challenging video retrieval, where temporal and visual factors may further influence model behavior. To explore this, we first construct a comprehensive benchmark dataset containing both real and AI-generated videos, along with a set of fair and rigorous metrics to assess bias. This benchmark consists of 13,000 videos generated by two state-of-the-art open-source video generation models. We meticulously design a suite of rigorous metrics to accurately measure this preference, accounting for potential biases arising from the limited frame rate and suboptimal quality of AIGC videos. We then applied three off-the-shelf video retrieval models to perform retrieval tasks on this hybrid dataset. Our findings reveal a clear preference for AI-generated videos in retrieval. Further investigation shows that incorporating AI-generated videos into the training set of retrieval models exacerbates this bias. Unlike the preference observed in image modalities, we find that video retrieval bias arises from both unseen visual and temporal information, making the root causes of video bias a complex interplay of these two factors. To mitigate this bias, we fine-tune the retrieval models using a contrastive learning approach. The results of this study highlight the potential implications of AI-generated videos on retrieval systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, Accepted at ACMMM2025</p></details> |
| **[T2VParser: Adaptive Decomposition Tokens for Partial Alignment in Text to Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20518v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video retrieval essentially aims to train models to align visual content with textual descriptions accurately. Due to the impressive general multimodal knowledge demonstrated by image-text pretrained models such as CLIP, existing work has primarily focused on extending CLIP knowledge for video-text tasks. However, videos typically contain richer information than images. In current video-text datasets, textual descriptions can only reflect a portion of the video content, leading to partial misalignment in video-text matching. Therefore, directly aligning text representations with video representations can result in incorrect supervision, ignoring the inequivalence of information. In this work, we propose T2VParser to extract multiview semantic representations from text and video, achieving adaptive semantic alignment rather than aligning the entire representation. To extract corresponding representations from different modalities, we introduce Adaptive Decomposition Tokens, which consist of a set of learnable tokens shared across modalities. The goal of T2VParser is to emphasize precise alignment between text and video while retaining the knowledge of pretrained models. Experimental results demonstrate that T2VParser achieves accurate partial alignment through effective cross-modal content decomposition. The code is available at https://github.com/Lilidamowang/T2VParser.</p></details> |  |
| **[HLFormer: Enhancing Partially Relevant Video Retrieval with Hyperbolic Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17402v2)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) addresses the critical challenge of matching untrimmed videos with text queries describing only partial content. Existing methods suffer from geometric distortion in Euclidean space that sometimes misrepresents the intrinsic hierarchical structure of videos and overlooks certain hierarchical semantics, ultimately leading to suboptimal temporal modeling. To address this issue, we propose the first hyperbolic modeling framework for PRVR, namely HLFormer, which leverages hyperbolic space learning to compensate for the suboptimal hierarchical modeling capabilities of Euclidean space. Specifically, HLFormer integrates the Lorentz Attention Block and Euclidean Attention Block to encode video embeddings in hybrid spaces, using the Mean-Guided Adaptive Interaction Module to dynamically fuse features. Additionally, we introduce a Partial Order Preservation Loss to enforce "text < video" hierarchy through Lorentzian cone constraints. This approach further enhances cross-modal matching by reinforcing partial relevance between video content and text queries. Extensive experiments show that HLFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Code is released at https://github.com/lijun2005/ICCV25-HLFormer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV'25. 13 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[FrameFusion: Combining Similarity and Importance for Video Token Reduction on Large Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01986v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand to process long and high-resolution videos significantly burdens Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the enormous number of visual tokens. Existing token reduction methods primarily prune tokens based on importance metrics, such as cumulative attention scores. However, even important tokens may exhibit high redundancy caused by similarity among adjacent video frames and repetitive visual elements. To address this limitation, we propose FrameFusion, a novel token reduction approach integrating similarity-based merging with importance-based pruning. We conduct a thorough study on token similarity characteristics, revealing three key insights: (1) spatially corresponding visual tokens between adjacent frames have higher cosine similarities compared to other token pairs; (2) high token similarities prominently decrease in deeper model layers; and (3) token similarity rankings are highly consistent across different layers. Guided by these observations, FrameFusion computes token similarities exclusively between corresponding visual tokens from adjacent frames, applies token merging at initial successive layers followed by pruning in deeper layers, and adopts a cascaded merging strategy to further enhance efficiency. We evaluate FrameFusion comprehensively across six diverse LVLMs, ranging from 2B to 72B parameters, using five video benchmarks encompassing video retrieval, question-answering, and spatial-temporal understanding tasks. Experiments show that FrameFusion reduces visual tokens by 70%, achieving 1.6-3.6x end-to-end speedups, with an average performance impact of less than 3%.

| **[Quantifying and Narrowing the Unknown: Interactive Text-to-Video Retrieval via Uncertainty Minimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15504v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances, Text-to-video retrieval (TVR) is still hindered by multiple inherent uncertainties, such as ambiguous textual queries, indistinct text-video mappings, and low-quality video frames. Although interactive systems have emerged to address these challenges by refining user intent through clarifying questions, current methods typically rely on heuristic or ad-hoc strategies without explicitly quantifying these uncertainties, limiting their effectiveness. Motivated by this gap, we propose UMIVR, an Uncertainty-Minimizing Interactive Text-to-Video Retrieval framework that explicitly quantifies three critical uncertainties-text ambiguity, mapping uncertainty, and frame uncertainty-via principled, training-free metrics: semantic entropy-based Text Ambiguity Score (TAS), Jensen-Shannon divergence-based Mapping Uncertainty Score (MUS), and a Temporal Quality-based Frame Sampler (TQFS). By adaptively generating targeted clarifying questions guided by these uncertainty measures, UMIVR iteratively refines user queries, significantly reducing retrieval ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate UMIVR's effectiveness, achieving notable gains in Recall@1 (69.2\% after 10 interactive rounds) on the MSR-VTT-1k dataset, thereby establishing an uncertainty-minimizing foundation for interactive TVR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Prompt-aware of Frame Sampling for Efficient Text-Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15491v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling efficient text-video retrieval on edge-end devices is critical for real-world applications. Yet, existing methods face a critical challenge in balancing accuracy and computational efficiency: uniform frame sampling methods ensure content coverage but incur prohibitive computational costs, while salient-frame sampling methods reduce overhead but suffer from query-agnostic frame selection that biases retrieval results. To address this, we propose ProCLIP, a user-centric framework that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly improved efficiency. We design a prompt-aware frame sampling strategy that dynamically guides lightweight feature extractors using textual prompts to select semantically relevant frames, overcoming the limitations of existing salient-frame sampling methods which rely on static, query-agnostic selection criteria. Moreover, we adopt a two-stage candidate pruning strategy that combines rapid coarse filtering via a lightweight module with CLIP-powered fine-grained re-ranking, enhancing retrieval efficiency while preserving accuracy. Experiments across benchmarks show ProCLIP achieves 75.3% latency reduction versus baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy, i.e., R@1=49.0 in MSR-VTT dataset.

| **[U-MARVEL: Unveiling Key Factors for Universal Multimodal Retrieval via Embedding Learning with MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14902v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Universal multimodal retrieval (UMR), which aims to address complex retrieval tasks where both queries and candidates span diverse modalities, has been significantly advanced by the emergence of MLLMs. While state-of-the-art MLLM-based methods in the literature predominantly adopt contrastive learning principles, they often differ in their specific training recipes. Despite their success, the mechanisms underlying their retrieval capabilities remain largely unexplored, potentially resulting in suboptimal performance and limited generalization ability. To address these issues, we present a comprehensive study aimed at uncovering the key factors that drive effective embedding learning for UMR using MLLMs. We begin by implementing a general MLLM-based embedding learning pipeline, and systematically analyze the primary contributors to high-performing universal retrieval systems. Based on this, we explore various aspects of the details in embedding generation and training strategies, including progressive transition, hard negative mining and re-ranker distillation. Notably, our findings reveal that often-overlooked factors can have a substantial impact on model performance. Building on these discoveries, we introduce a unified framework termed U-MARVEL (\textbf{U}niversal \textbf{M}ultimod\textbf{A}l \textbf{R}etrie\textbf{V}al via \textbf{E}mbedding \textbf{L}earning), which outperforms state-of-the-art competitors on the M-BEIR benchmark by a large margin in supervised settings, and also exihibits strong zero-shot performance on several tasks such as composed image retrieval and text-to-video retrieval. These results underscore the generalization potential of our framework across various embedding-based retrieval tasks.

While dense text captions can achieve 75.9% Recall@5, they require expensive offline processing and miss critical visual information present in 34% of clips with scene text not captured by ASR. By analyzing query intent and predicting information needs, ModaRoute reduces computational overhead by 41% while achieving 60.9% Recall@5. Our approach uses GPT-4.1 to route queries across ASR (speech), OCR (text), and visual indices, averaging 1.78 modalities per query versus exhaustive 3.0 modality search. Evaluation on 1.8M video clips demonstrates that intelligent routing provides a practical solution for scaling multimodal retrieval systems, reducing infrastructure costs while maintaining competitive effectiveness for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025 Multimodal Representation and Retrieval Workshop</p></details> |

However, most existing methods and datasets focus exclusively on English. Despite Indonesian being one of the most widely spoken languages, multimodal research in Indonesian remains under-explored, largely due to the lack of benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the first public Indonesian video-text dataset by translating the English captions in the MSVD dataset into Indonesian. Using this dataset, we evaluate neural network models which were developed for the English video-text dataset on three tasks, i.e., text-to-video retrieval, video-to-text retrieval, and video captioning. Most existing models rely on feature extractors pretrained on English vision-language datasets, raising concerns about their applicability to Indonesian, given the scarcity of large-scale pretraining resources in the language. We apply a cross-lingual transfer learning approach by leveraging English-pretrained extractors and fine-tuning models on our Indonesian dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy improves performance across all tasks and metrics. We release our dataset publicly to support future research and hope it will inspire further progress in Indonesian multimodal learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

To address this, we propose BiMa, a novel framework designed to mitigate biases in both visual and textual representations. Our approach begins by generating scene elements that characterize each video by identifying relevant entities/objects and activities. For visual debiasing, we integrate these scene elements into the video embeddings, enhancing them to emphasize fine-grained and salient details. For textual debiasing, we introduce a mechanism to disentangle text features into content and bias components, enabling the model to focus on meaningful content while separately handling biased information. Extensive experiments and ablation studies across five major TVR benchmarks (i.e., MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, ActivityNet, and DiDeMo) demonstrate the competitive performance of BiMa. Additionally, the model's bias mitigation capability is consistently validated by its strong results on out-of-distribution retrieval tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

However, existing multimodal embeddings like VLM2Vec, E5-V, GME are predominantly focused on natural images, with limited support for other visual forms such as videos and visual documents. This restricts their applicability in real-world scenarios, including AI agents, multi-modal search and recommendation, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To close this gap, we propose VLM2Vec-V2, a unified framework for learning embeddings across diverse visual forms. First, we introduce MMEB-V2, a comprehensive benchmark that extends MMEB with five new task types: visual document retrieval, video retrieval, temporal grounding, video classification and video question answering - spanning text, image, video, and visual document inputs. Next, we train VLM2Vec-V2, a general-purpose embedding model that supports text, image, video, and visual document inputs. Extensive experiments show that VLM2Vec-V2 achieves strong performance not only on the newly introduced video and document retrieval tasks, but also improves over prior baselines on the original image benchmarks. Through extensive evaluation, our study offers insights into the generalizability of various multimodal embedding models and highlights effective strategies for unified embedding learning, laying the groundwork for more scalable and adaptable representation learning in both research and real-world settings.</p></details> | Technical Report |

A Benchmark for Retrieval-Centric Evaluation of Synthetic Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02316v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis has advanced rapidly, yet current evaluation metrics primarily capture visual quality and temporal consistency, offering limited insight into how synthetic videos perform in downstream tasks such as text-to-video retrieval (TVR). In this work, we introduce SynTVA, a new dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate the utility of synthetic videos for building retrieval models. Based on 800 diverse user queries derived from MSRVTT training split, we generate synthetic videos using state-of-the-art T2V models and annotate each video-text pair along four key semantic alignment dimensions: Object \& Scene, Action, Attribute, and Prompt Fidelity. Our evaluation framework correlates general video quality assessment (VQA) metrics with these alignment scores, and examines their predictive power for downstream TVR performance. To explore pathways of scaling up, we further develop an Auto-Evaluator to estimate alignment quality from existing metrics. Beyond benchmarking, our results show that SynTVA is a valuable asset for dataset augmentation, enabling the selection of high-utility synthetic samples that measurably improve TVR outcomes.

While classification remains the dominant approach for content moderation, it often struggles in scenarios requiring rapid and cost-efficient responses, such as trend adaptation and urgent escalations. To address this issue, we introduce an Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) method designed to complement traditional classification approaches. We first leverage a Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL) framework to train a suite of foundation embedding models, including both single-modal and multi-modal architectures. Our models demonstrate superior performance over established contrastive learning methods such as CLIP and MoCo. Building on these embedding models, we design and implement the embedding-based retrieval system that integrates embedding generation and video retrieval to enable efficient and effective trend handling. Comprehensive offline experiments on 25 diverse emerging trends show that EBR improves ROC-AUC from 0.85 to 0.99 and PR-AUC from 0.35 to 0.95. Further online experiments reveal that EBR increases action rates by 10.32% and reduces operational costs by over 80%, while also enhancing interpretability and flexibility compared to classification-based solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera ready for SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

Although in-network computation has emerged as a compelling strategy for accelerating feature extraction and reducing overhead in distributed multimedia systems, harnessing advanced networking resources at both the switch and host levels remains a formidable challenge. These difficulties are compounded by heterogeneous hardware, diverse application requirements, and complex multipath topologies. Existing methods focus primarily on optimizing inference for large neural network models using specialized collective communication libraries, which often face performance degradation in network congestion scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we present ViFusion, a communication aware tensor fusion framework that streamlines distributed video indexing by merging numerous small feature tensors into consolidated and more manageable units. By integrating an in-network computation module and a dedicated tensor fusion mechanism within datacenter environments, ViFusion substantially improves the efficiency of video feature indexing workflows. The deployment results show that ViFusion improves the throughput of the video retrieval system by 8--22 times with the same level of latency as state-of-the-art systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks for video question answering remain limited in scope, typically involving one clip per query, which falls short of representing the challenges of large-scale, audio-visual retrieval and reasoning encountered in practical applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task named AV-HaystacksQA, where the goal is to identify salient segments across different videos in response to a query and link them together to generate the most informative answer. To this end, we present AVHaystacks, an audio-visual benchmark comprising 3100 annotated QA pairs designed to assess the capabilities of LMMs in multi-video retrieval and temporal grounding task. Additionally, we propose a model-agnostic, multi-agent framework MAGNET to address this challenge, achieving up to 89% and 65% relative improvements over baseline methods on BLEU@4 and GPT evaluation scores in QA task on our proposed AVHaystacks. To enable robust evaluation of multi-video retrieval and temporal grounding for optimal response generation, we introduce two new metrics, STEM, which captures alignment errors between a ground truth and a predicted step sequence and MTGS, to facilitate balanced and interpretable evaluation of segment-level grounding performance.

In this work, we consider how we can improve the identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore unified retrieval methods using OmniEmbed, a powerful multimodal embedding model from the Tevatron 2.0 toolkit, in the context of the MAGMaR shared task. Evaluated on the comprehensive MultiVENT 2.0 dataset, OmniEmbed generates unified embeddings for text, images, audio, and video, enabling robust multimodal retrieval. By finetuning OmniEmbed with the combined multimodal data--visual frames, audio tracks, and textual descriptions provided in MultiVENT 2.0, we achieve substantial improvements in complex, multilingual video retrieval tasks. Our submission achieved the highest score on the MAGMaR shared task leaderboard among public submissions as of May 20th, 2025, highlighting the practical effectiveness of our unified multimodal retrieval approach.

Typical training processes of PRVR assume a one-to-one relationship where each text query is relevant to only one video. However, we point out the inherent ambiguity between text and video content based on their conceptual scope and propose a framework that incorporates this ambiguity into the model learning process. Specifically, we propose Ambiguity-Restrained representation Learning~(ARL) to address ambiguous text-video pairs. Initially, ARL detects ambiguous pairs based on two criteria: uncertainty and similarity. Uncertainty represents whether instances include commonly shared context across the dataset, while similarity indicates pair-wise semantic overlap. Then, with the detected ambiguous pairs, our ARL hierarchically learns the semantic relationship via multi-positive contrastive learning and dual triplet margin loss. Additionally, we delve into fine-grained relationships within the video instances. Unlike typical training at the text-video level, where pairwise information is provided, we address the inherent ambiguity within frames of the same untrimmed video, which often contains multiple contexts. This allows us to further enhance learning at the text-frame level. Lastly, we propose cross-model ambiguity detection to mitigate the error propagation that occurs when a single model is employed to detect ambiguous pairs for its training. With all components combined, our proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness in PRVR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[From Play to Replay: Composed Video Retrieval for Temporally Fine-Grained Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05274v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) retrieves a target video given a query video and a modification text describing the intended change. Existing CoVR benchmarks emphasize appearance shifts or coarse event changes and therefore do not test the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences. We introduce TF-CoVR, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to temporally fine-grained CoVR. TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K triplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing on temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the same video, limiting practical usefulness. In TF-CoVR, we instead construct each <query, modification> pair by prompting an LLM with the label differences between clips drawn from different videos; every pair is thus associated with multiple valid target videos (3.9 on average), reflecting real-world tasks such as sports-highlight generation. To model these temporal dynamics we propose TF-CoVR-Base, a concise two-stage training framework: (i) pre-train a video encoder on fine-grained action classification to obtain temporally discriminative embeddings; (ii) align the composed query with candidate videos using contrastive learning. We conduct the first comprehensive study of image, video, and general multimodal embedding (GME) models on temporally fine-grained composed retrieval in both zero-shot and fine-tuning regimes. On TF-CoVR, TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 (LanguageBind) to 7.51, and after fine-tuning raises the state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 25.82.</p></details> |  |

It is designed to identify and retrieve untrimmed videos that are partially relevant to the provided query. In this work, we investigate long-sequence video content understanding to address information redundancy issues. Leveraging the outstanding long-term state space modeling capability and linear scalability of the Mamba module, we introduce a multi-Mamba module with temporal fusion framework (MamFusion) tailored for PRVR task. This framework effectively captures the state-relatedness in long-term video content and seamlessly integrates it into text-video relevance understanding, thereby enhancing the retrieval process. Specifically, we introduce Temporal T-to-V Fusion and Temporal V-to-T Fusion to explicitly model temporal relationships between text queries and video moments, improving contextual awareness and retrieval accuracy. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale datasets demonstrate that MamFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in retrieval effectiveness.

| **[Uneven Event Modeling for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00891v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a text query, partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant moments, wherein event modeling is crucial for partitioning the video into smaller temporal events that partially correspond to the text. Previous methods typically segment videos into a fixed number of equal-length clips, resulting in ambiguous event boundaries. Additionally, they rely on mean pooling to compute event representations, inevitably introducing undesired misalignment. To address these, we propose an Uneven Event Modeling (UEM) framework for PRVR. We first introduce the Progressive-Grouped Video Segmentation (PGVS) module, to iteratively formulate events in light of both temporal dependencies and semantic similarity between consecutive frames, enabling clear event boundaries. Furthermore, we also propose the Context-Aware Event Refinement (CAER) module to refine the event representation conditioned the text's cross-attention. This enables event representations to focus on the most relevant frames for a given text, facilitating more precise text-video alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two PRVR benchmarks.

However, existing query-answer datasets primarily focus on textual responses, making it challenging to address complex user queries that require visual demonstrations or explanations for better understanding. To bridge this gap, we construct a benchmark, RealVideoQuest, designed to evaluate the abilities of text-to-video (T2V) models in answering real-world, visually grounded queries. It identifies 7.5K real user queries with video response intents from Chatbot-Arena and builds 4.5K high-quality query-video pairs through a multistage video retrieval and refinement process. We further develop a multi-angle evaluation system to assess the quality of generated video answers. Experiments indicate that current T2V models struggle with effectively addressing real user queries, pointing to key challenges and future research opportunities in multimodal AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Alignment with Semantic Gap-Aware Corrections in Text-Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12499v4)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-video retrieval have been largely driven by contrastive learning frameworks. However, existing methods overlook a key source of optimization tension: the separation between text and video distributions in the representation space (referred to as the modality gap), and the prevalence of false negatives in batch sampling. These factors lead to conflicting gradients under the InfoNCE loss, impeding stable alignment. To mitigate this, we propose GARE, a Gap-Aware Retrieval framework that introduces a learnable, pair-specific increment Delta_ij between text t_i and video v_j to offload the tension from the global anchor representation. We first derive the ideal form of Delta_ij via a coupled multivariate first-order Taylor approximation of the InfoNCE loss under a trust-region constraint, revealing it as a mechanism for resolving gradient conflicts by guiding updates along a locally optimal descent direction. Due to the high cost of directly computing Delta_ij, we introduce a lightweight neural module conditioned on the semantic gap between each video-text pair, enabling structure-aware correction guided by gradient supervision. To further stabilize learning and promote interpretability, we regularize Delta using three components: a trust-region constraint to prevent oscillation, a directional diversity term to promote semantic coverage, and an information bottleneck to limit redundancy. Experiments across four retrieval benchmarks show that GARE consistently improves alignment accuracy and robustness to noisy supervision, confirming the effectiveness of gap-aware tension mitigation.</p></details> |  |

This work first introduces a comprehensive analysis that identifies four key characteristics essential for the effective adaptation of RoPE to video, which have not been fully considered in prior work. As part of our analysis, we introduce a challenging V-NIAH-D (Visual Needle-In-A-Haystack with Distractors) task, which adds periodic distractors into V-NIAH. The V-NIAH-D task demonstrates that previous RoPE variants, lacking appropriate temporal dimension allocation, are easily misled by distractors. Based on our analysis, we introduce \textbf{VideoRoPE}, with a \textit{3D structure} designed to preserve spatio-temporal relationships. VideoRoPE features \textit{low-frequency temporal allocation} to mitigate periodic oscillations, a \textit{diagonal layout} to maintain spatial symmetry, and \textit{adjustable temporal spacing} to decouple temporal and spatial indexing. VideoRoPE consistently surpasses previous RoPE variants, across diverse downstream tasks such as long video retrieval, video understanding, and video hallucination. Our code will be available at \href{https://github.com/Wiselnn570/VideoRoPE}{https://github.com/Wiselnn570/VideoRoPE}.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods rely solely on aligning video and text modalities to compute the similarity and retrieve relevant items. However, recent advancements emphasise incorporating auxiliary information extracted from video and text modalities to improve retrieval performance and bridge the semantic gap between these modalities. Auxiliary information can include visual attributes, such as objects; temporal and spatial context; and textual descriptions, such as speech and rephrased captions. This survey comprehensively reviews 81 research papers on Text-to-Video retrieval that utilise such auxiliary information. It provides a detailed analysis of their methodologies; highlights state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets; and discusses available datasets and their auxiliary information. Additionally, it proposes promising directions for future research, focusing on different ways to further enhance retrieval performance using this information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning World Models for Interactive Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21996v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundational world models must be both interactive and preserve spatiotemporal coherence for effective future planning with action choices. However, present models for long video generation have limited inherent world modeling capabilities due to two main challenges: compounding errors and insufficient memory mechanisms. We enhance image-to-video models with interactive capabilities through additional action conditioning and autoregressive framework, and reveal that compounding error is inherently irreducible in autoregressive video generation, while insufficient memory mechanism leads to incoherence of world models. We propose video retrieval augmented generation (VRAG) with explicit global state conditioning, which significantly reduces long-term compounding errors and increases spatiotemporal consistency of world models. In contrast, naive autoregressive generation with extended context windows and retrieval-augmented generation prove less effective for video generation, primarily due to the limited in-context learning capabilities of current video models. Our work illuminates the fundamental challenges in video world models and establishes a comprehensive benchmark for improving video generation models with internal world modeling capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoVR: A Benchmark for Long Video Retrieval in Multimodal Contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13928v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long videos contain a vast amount of information, making video-text retrieval an essential and challenging task in multimodal learning. However, existing benchmarks suffer from limited video duration, low-quality captions, and coarse annotation granularity, which hinder the evaluation of advanced video-text retrieval methods. To address these limitations, we introduce LoVR, a benchmark specifically designed for long video-text retrieval. LoVR contains 467 long videos and over 40,804 fine-grained clips with high-quality captions. To overcome the issue of poor machine-generated annotations, we propose an efficient caption generation framework that integrates VLM automatic generation, caption quality scoring, and dynamic refinement. This pipeline improves annotation accuracy while maintaining scalability. Furthermore, we introduce a semantic fusion method to generate coherent full-video captions without losing important contextual information. Our benchmark introduces longer videos, more detailed captions, and a larger-scale dataset, presenting new challenges for video understanding and retrieval. Extensive experiments on various advanced embedding models demonstrate that LoVR is a challenging benchmark, revealing the limitations of current approaches and providing valuable insights for future research.

| **[MomentSeeker: A Task-Oriented Benchmark For Long-Video Moment Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12558v4)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately locating key moments within long videos is crucial for solving long video understanding (LVU) tasks. However, existing benchmarks are either severely limited in terms of video length and task diversity, or they focus solely on the end-to-end LVU performance, making them inappropriate for evaluating whether key moments can be accurately accessed. To address this challenge, we propose MomentSeeker, a novel benchmark for long-video moment retrieval (LMVR), distinguished by the following features. First, it is created based on long and diverse videos, averaging over 1200 seconds in duration and collected from various domains, e.g., movie, anomaly, egocentric, and sports. Second, it covers a variety of real-world scenarios in three levels: global-level, event-level, object-level, covering common tasks like action recognition, object localization, and causal reasoning, etc. Third, it incorporates rich forms of queries, including text-only queries, image-conditioned queries, and video-conditioned queries. On top of MomentSeeker, we conduct comprehensive experiments for both generation-based approaches (directly using MLLMs) and retrieval-based approaches (leveraging video retrievers). Our results reveal the significant challenges in long-video moment retrieval in terms of accuracy and efficiency, despite improvements from the latest long-video MLLMs and task-specific fine-tuning. We have publicly released MomentSeeker(https://yhy-2000.github.io/MomentSeeker/) to facilitate future research in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Challenge to Build Neuro-Symbolic Video Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13851v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern video understanding systems excel at tasks such as scene classification, object detection, and short video retrieval. However, as video analysis becomes increasingly central to real-world applications, there is a growing need for proactive video agents for the systems that not only interpret video streams but also reason about events and take informed actions. A key obstacle in this direction is temporal reasoning: while deep learning models have made remarkable progress in recognizing patterns within individual frames or short clips, they struggle to understand the sequencing and dependencies of events over time, which is critical for action-driven decision-making. Addressing this limitation demands moving beyond conventional deep learning approaches. We posit that tackling this challenge requires a neuro-symbolic perspective, where video queries are decomposed into atomic events, structured into coherent sequences, and validated against temporal constraints. Such an approach can enhance interpretability, enable structured reasoning, and provide stronger guarantees on system behavior, all key properties for advancing trustworthy video agents. To this end, we present a grand challenge to the research community: developing the next generation of intelligent video agents that integrate three core capabilities: (1) autonomous video search and analysis, (2) seamless real-world interaction, and (3) advanced content generation. By addressing these pillars, we can transition from passive perception to intelligent video agents that reason, predict, and act, pushing the boundaries of video understanding.</p></details> |  |

However, existing systems are often constrained to specific, predefined tasks, limiting their adaptability in open-ended analytical scenarios. The recent emergence of Video-Language Models (VLMs) as transformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling open-ended video understanding, reasoning, and analytics. Nevertheless, their limited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video content, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we introduce AVAS, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video analytics. AVAS incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time construction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or continuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism that leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that AVAS achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy, respectively, significantly surpassing existing VLM and video Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video analytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new benchmark, AVAS-100. This benchmark comprises 8 videos, each exceeding 10 hours in duration, along with 120 manually annotated, diverse, and complex question-answer pairs. On AVAS-100, AVAS achieves top-tier performance with an accuracy of 75.8%.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, AVAS, add latency breakdown</p></details> |

When designing robust computer vision systems, removing adverse weather such as haze, rain, and snow is a significant problem. Recently, deep-learning methods offered a solution for a single type of degradation. Current state-of-the-art universal methods struggle with combinations of degradations, such as haze and rain-streak. Few algorithms have been developed that perform well when presented with images containing multiple adverse weather conditions. This work focuses on developing an efficient solution for multiple adverse weather removal using a unified quaternion neural architecture called CMAWRNet. It is based on a novel texture-structure decomposition block, a novel lightweight encoder-decoder quaternion transformer architecture, and an attentive fusion block with low-light correction. We also introduce a quaternion similarity loss function to preserve color information better. The quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the current state-of-the-art benchmarking datasets and real-world images shows the performance advantages of the proposed CMAWRNet compared to other state-of-the-art weather removal approaches dealing with multiple weather artifacts. Extensive computer simulations validate that CMAWRNet improves the performance of downstream applications such as object detection. This is the first time the decomposition approach has been applied to the universal weather removal task.</p></details> |  |

Online learning, which processes streaming data in real-time, offers a promising solution to these issues while also allowing swift adaptations in scenarios demanding real-time responsiveness. One strategy to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of learning involves identifying and prioritizing data that enhances performance on target downstream tasks. We propose Relevance and Specificity-based online filtering framework (ReSpec) that selects data based on four criteria: (i) modality alignment for clean data, (ii) task relevance for target focused data, (iii) specificity for informative and detailed data, and (iv) efficiency for low-latency processing. Relevance is determined by the probabilistic alignment of incoming data with downstream tasks, while specificity employs the distance to a root embedding representing the least specific data as an efficient proxy for informativeness. By establishing reference points from target task data, ReSpec filters incoming data in real-time, eliminating the need for extensive storage and compute. Evaluating on large-scale datasets WebVid2M and VideoCC3M, ReSpec attains state-of-the-art performance on five zeroshot video retrieval tasks, using as little as 5% of the data while incurring minimal compute.

This challenge is particularly pronounced in partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR), where incorporating more diverse context representations at varying temporal scales for each video enhances accuracy but increases computational and memory costs. To address this dichotomy, we propose a prototypical PRVR framework that encodes diverse contexts within a video into a fixed number of prototypes. We then introduce several strategies to enhance text association and video understanding within the prototypes, along with an orthogonal objective to ensure that the prototypes capture a diverse range of content. To keep the prototypes searchable via text queries while accurately encoding video contexts, we implement cross- and uni-modal reconstruction tasks. The cross-modal reconstruction task aligns the prototypes with textual features within a shared space, while the uni-modal reconstruction task preserves all video contexts during encoding. Additionally, we employ a video mixing technique to provide weak guidance to further align prototypes and associated textual representations. Extensive evaluations on TVR, ActivityNet-Captions, and QVHighlights validate the effectiveness of our approach without sacrificing efficiency.</p></details> |  |

The pursuit here is of both effective and efficient solutions to capture the partial correspondence between text queries and untrimmed videos. Existing PRVR methods, which typically focus on modeling multi-scale clip representations, however, suffer from content independence and information redundancy, impairing retrieval performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective approach with active moment discovering (AMDNet). We are committed to discovering video moments that are semantically consistent with their queries. By using learnable span anchors to capture distinct moments and applying masked multi-moment attention to emphasize salient moments while suppressing redundant backgrounds, we achieve more compact and informative video representations. To further enhance moment modeling, we introduce a moment diversity loss to encourage different moments of distinct regions and a moment relevance loss to promote semantically query-relevant moments, which cooperate with a partially relevant retrieval loss for end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on two large-scale video datasets (\ie, TVR and ActivityNet Captions) demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of our AMDNet. In particular, AMDNet is about 15.5 times smaller (\#parameters) while 6.0 points higher (SumR) than the up-to-date method GMMFormer on TVR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM) on January 19, 2025.

Current retrieval systems are constrained by computational inefficiencies, temporal context limitations, and the intrinsic complexity of navigating video content. In this paper, we address these limitations through a novel Interactive Video Corpus Moment Retrieval framework that integrates a SuperGlobal Reranking mechanism and Adaptive Bidirectional Temporal Search (ABTS), strategically optimizing query similarity, temporal stability, and computational resources. By preprocessing a large corpus of videos using a keyframe extraction model and deduplication technique through image hashing, our approach provides a scalable solution that significantly reduces storage requirements while maintaining high localization precision across diverse video repositories.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods for skill-assessment from video only provide scores or compare demonstrations, leaving the burden of knowing what to do differently on the user. We introduce a novel method to generate actionable feedback (AF) from video of a person doing a physical activity, such as basketball or soccer. Our method takes a video demonstration and its accompanying 3D body pose and generates (1) free-form expert commentary describing what the person is doing well and what they could improve, and (2) a visual expert demonstration that incorporates the required corrections. We show how to leverage Ego-Exo4D's [29] videos of skilled activity and expert commentary together with a strong language model to create a weakly-supervised training dataset for this task, and we devise a multimodal video-language model to infer coaching feedback. Our method is able to reason across multi-modal input combinations to output full spectrum, actionable coaching-expert commentary, expert video retrieval, and expert pose generation-outperforming strong vision-language models on both established metrics and human preference studies.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Existing approaches often rely on single models, inefficient storage, unstable temporal search, and context-agnostic reranking, limiting their effectiveness. This paper presents a novel framework to enhance interactive video retrieval through four key innovations: (1) an ensemble search strategy that integrates coarse-grained (CLIP) and fine-grained (BEIT3) models to improve retrieval accuracy, (2) a storage optimization technique that reduces redundancy by selecting representative keyframes via TransNetV2 and deduplication, (3) a temporal search mechanism that localizes video segments using dual queries for start and end points, and (4) a temporal reranking approach that leverages neighboring frame context to stabilize rankings. Evaluated on known-item search and question-answering tasks, our framework demonstrates substantial improvements in retrieval precision, efficiency, and user interpretability, offering a robust solution for real-world interactive video retrieval applications.</p></details> |  |

However, as video content evolves continuously, adapting TVR systems to new data remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark for Continual Text-to-Video Retrieval (CTVR) to address the limitations of existing approaches. Current Pre-Trained Model (PTM)-based TVR methods struggle with maintaining model plasticity when adapting to new tasks, while existing Continual Learning (CL) methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to semantic misalignment between historical queries and stored video features. To address these two challenges, we propose FrameFusionMoE, a novel CTVR framework that comprises two key components: (1) the Frame Fusion Adapter (FFA), which captures temporal video dynamics while preserving model plasticity, and (2) the Task-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (TAME), which ensures consistent semantic alignment between queries across tasks and the stored video features. Thus, FrameFusionMoE enables effective adaptation to new video content while preserving historical text-video relevance to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We comprehensively evaluate FrameFusionMoE on two benchmark datasets under various task settings. Results demonstrate that FrameFusionMoE outperforms existing CL and TVR methods, achieving superior retrieval performance with minimal degradation on earlier tasks when handling continuous video streams.

However, due to the wider semantic range of videos, the text-agnostic video representations might encode misleading information not described in texts, thus impeding the model from capturing precise cross-modal semantic correspondence. To this end, we propose a Text-Conditioned Multi-Grained Contrast framework, dubbed TC-MGC. Specifically, our model employs a language-video attention block to generate aggregated frame and video representations conditioned on the word's and text's attention weights over frames. To filter unnecessary similarity interactions and decrease trainable parameters in the Interactive Similarity Aggregation (ISA) module, we design a Similarity Reorganization (SR) module to identify attentive similarities and reorganize cross-modal similarity vectors and matrices. Next, we argue that the imbalance problem among multigrained similarities may result in over- and under-representation issues. We thereby introduce an auxiliary Similarity Decorrelation Regularization (SDR) loss to facilitate cooperative relationship utilization by similarity variance minimization on matching text-video pairs. Finally, we present a Linear Softmax Aggregation (LSA) module to explicitly encourage the interactions between multiple similarities and promote the usage of multi-grained information. Empirically, TC-MGC achieves competitive results on multiple text-video retrieval benchmarks, outperforming X-CLIP model by +2.8% (+1.3%), +2.2% (+1.0%), +1.5% (+0.9%) relative (absolute) improvements in text-to-video retrieval R@1 on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo and VATEX, respectively.

| **[Multimodal Lengthy Videos Retrieval Framework and Evaluation Metric](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04572v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise video retrieval requires multi-modal correlations to handle unseen vocabulary and scenes, becoming more complex for lengthy videos where models must perform effectively without prior training on a specific dataset. We introduce a unified framework that combines a visual matching stream and an aural matching stream with a unique subtitles-based video segmentation approach. Additionally, the aural stream includes a complementary audio-based two-stage retrieval mechanism that enhances performance on long-duration videos. Considering the complex nature of retrieval from lengthy videos and its corresponding evaluation, we introduce a new retrieval evaluation method specifically designed for long-video retrieval to support further research. We conducted experiments on the YouCook2 benchmark, showing promising retrieval performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[ContextIQ: A Multimodal Expert-Based Video Retrieval System for Contextual Advertising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22233v3)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contextual advertising serves ads that are aligned to the content that the user is viewing. The rapid growth of video content on social platforms and streaming services, along with privacy concerns, has increased the need for contextual advertising. Placing the right ad in the right context creates a seamless and pleasant ad viewing experience, resulting in higher audience engagement and, ultimately, better ad monetization. From a technology standpoint, effective contextual advertising requires a video retrieval system capable of understanding complex video content at a very granular level. Current text-to-video retrieval models based on joint multimodal training demand large datasets and computational resources, limiting their practicality and lacking the key functionalities required for ad ecosystem integration. We introduce ContextIQ, a multimodal expert-based video retrieval system designed specifically for contextual advertising. ContextIQ utilizes modality-specific experts-video, audio, transcript (captions), and metadata such as objects, actions, emotion, etc.-to create semantically rich video representations. We show that our system, without joint training, achieves better or comparable results to state-of-the-art models and commercial solutions on multiple text-to-video retrieval benchmarks. Our ablation studies highlight the benefits of leveraging multiple modalities for enhanced video retrieval accuracy instead of using a vision-language model alone. Furthermore, we show how video retrieval systems such as ContextIQ can be used for contextual advertising in an ad ecosystem while also addressing concerns related to brand safety and filtering inappropriate content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Narrating the Video: Boosting Text-Video Retrieval via Comprehensive Utilization of Frame-Level Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05186v4)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent text-video retrieval, the use of additional captions from vision-language models has shown promising effects on the performance. However, existing models using additional captions often have struggled to capture the rich semantics, including temporal changes, inherent in the video. In addition, incorrect information caused by generative models can lead to inaccurate retrieval. To address these issues, we propose a new framework, Narrating the Video (NarVid), which strategically leverages the comprehensive information available from frame-level captions, the narration. The proposed NarVid exploits narration in multiple ways: 1) feature enhancement through cross-modal interactions between narration and video, 2) query-aware adaptive filtering to suppress irrelevant or incorrect information, 3) dual-modal matching score by adding query-video similarity and query-narration similarity, and 4) hard-negative loss to learn discriminative features from multiple perspectives using the two similarities from different views. Experimental results demonstrate that NarVid achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Inspired by the success of late interaction techniques in text-document, text-image, and text-video retrieval, our approach, Video-ColBERT, introduces a simple and efficient mechanism for fine-grained similarity assessment between queries and videos. Video-ColBERT is built upon 3 main components: a fine-grained spatial and temporal token-wise interaction, query and visual expansions, and a dual sigmoid loss during training. We find that this interaction and training paradigm leads to strong individual, yet compatible, representations for encoding video content. These representations lead to increases in performance on common text-to-video retrieval benchmarks compared to other bi-encoder methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025. 13 pages, 4 figures.

While vision-language models (VLMs) excel in representation learning, they often struggle with adaptive, time-sensitive video retrieval. This paper introduces a novel framework that combines vector similarity search with graph-based data structures. By leveraging VLM embeddings for initial retrieval and modeling contextual relationships among video segments, our approach enables adaptive query refinement and improves retrieval accuracy. Experiments demonstrate its precision, scalability, and robustness, offering an effective solution for interactive video retrieval in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

The existing video retrieval and caption benchmarks only include short descriptions, limits their ability of detailed video understanding evaluation. To address this problem, we present CaReBench, a testing benchmark for fine-grained video captioning and retrieval with 1,000 high-quality pairs of videos and human-annotated detailed captions. Uniquely, it provides manually separated spatial annotations and temporal annotations for each video. Based on this design, we introduce two evaluation metrics, ReBias and CapST, specifically tailored for video retrieval and video captioning tasks, respectively. These metrics enable a comprehensive investigation into the spatial and temporal biases inherent in VLMs. In addition, to handle both video retrieval and video captioning tasks in a unified framework, we develop a simple baseline based on a Multimodal Language Model (MLLM). By implementing a two-stage Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), we fully unlock the potential of MLLM, enabling it not only to generate detailed video descriptions but also to extract video features. Surprisingly, experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the CLIP-based models designed for retrieval and the popular MLLMs skilled in video captioning, our baseline shows competitive performance in both fine-grained video retrieval and video detailed captioning.</p></details> |  |

Yet, traditional approaches demand substantial computing power and are often bottlenecked by GPU memory. To tackle this issue, we present Long-Video Memory Network, Long-VMNet, a novel video understanding method that employs a fixed-size memory representation to store discriminative patches sampled from the input video. Long-VMNet achieves improved efficiency by leveraging a neural sampler that identifies discriminative tokens. Additionally, Long-VMNet only needs one scan through the video, greatly boosting efficiency. Our results on the Rest-ADL dataset demonstrate an 18x -- 75x improvement in inference times for long-form video retrieval and answering questions, with a competitive predictive performance.</p></details> |  |

LLM-Based Curation for a Data-Efficient Audio-Video Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09205v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains challenging. We present Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA), which aligns audiovisual (AV) scene content beyond mere temporal synchronization via a Large Language Model (LLM)-based data curation pipeline. Specifically, AVVA scores and selects high-quality training clips using Whisper (speech-based audio foundation model) for audio and DINOv2 for video within a dual-encoder contrastive learning framework. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate that this approach can achieve significant accuracy gains with substantially less curated data. For instance, AVVA yields a 7.6% improvement in top-1 accuracy for audio-to-video retrieval on VGGSound compared to ImageBind, despite training on only 192 hours of carefully filtered data (vs. 5800+ hours). Moreover, an ablation study highlights that trading data quantity for data quality improves performance, yielding respective top-3 accuracy increases of 47.8, 48.4, and 58.0 percentage points on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound over uncurated baselines. While these results underscore AVVA's data efficiency, we also discuss the overhead of LLM-driven curation and how it may be scaled or approximated in larger domains. Overall, AVVA provides a viable path toward more robust, text-free audiovisual learning with improved retrieval accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ar...</summary><p>We are withdrawing this version due to the need for substantial updates in scope and organization, which affect the clarity and completeness of the manuscript.

| **[TempMe: Video Temporal Token Merging for Efficient Text-Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01156v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most text-video retrieval methods utilize the text-image pre-trained models like CLIP as a backbone. These methods process each sampled frame independently by the image encoder, resulting in high computational overhead and limiting practical deployment. Addressing this, we focus on efficient text-video retrieval by tackling two key challenges: 1. From the perspective of trainable parameters, current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods incur high inference costs; 2. From the perspective of model complexity, current token compression methods are mainly designed for images to reduce spatial redundancy but overlook temporal redundancy in consecutive frames of a video. To tackle these challenges, we propose Temporal Token Merging (TempMe), a parameter-efficient and training-inference efficient text-video retrieval architecture that minimizes trainable parameters and model complexity. Specifically, we introduce a progressive multi-granularity framework. By gradually combining neighboring clips, we reduce spatio-temporal redundancy and enhance temporal modeling across different frames, leading to improved efficiency and performance. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our TempMe. Compared to previous parameter-efficient text-video retrieval methods, TempMe achieves superior performance with just 0.50M trainable parameters. It significantly reduces output tokens by 95% and GFLOPs by 51%, while achieving a 1.8X speedup and a 4.4% R-Sum improvement. With full fine-tuning, TempMe achieves a significant 7.9% R-Sum improvement, trains 1.57X faster, and utilizes 75.2% GPU memory usage.

| **[Bridging Information Asymmetry in Text-video Retrieval: A Data-centric Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07249v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As online video content rapidly grows, the task of text-video retrieval (TVR) becomes increasingly important. A key challenge in TVR is the information asymmetry between video and text: videos are inherently richer in information, while their textual descriptions often capture only fragments of this complexity. This paper introduces a novel, data-centric framework to bridge this gap by enriching textual representations to better match the richness of video content. During training, videos are segmented into event-level clips and captioned to ensure comprehensive coverage. During retrieval, a large language model (LLM) generates semantically diverse queries to capture a broader range of possible matches. To enhance retrieval efficiency, we propose a query selection mechanism that identifies the most relevant and diverse queries, reducing computational cost while improving accuracy. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the power of data-centric approaches in addressing information asymmetry in TVR. This work paves the way for new research focused on leveraging data to improve cross-modal retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[LLaVE: Large Language and Vision Embedding Models with Hardness-Weighted Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04812v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Universal multimodal embedding models play a critical role in tasks such as interleaved image-text retrieval, multimodal RAG, and multimodal clustering. However, our empirical results indicate that existing LMM-based embedding models trained with the standard InfoNCE loss exhibit a high degree of overlap in similarity distribution between positive and negative pairs, making it challenging to distinguish hard negative pairs effectively. To deal with this issue, we propose a simple yet effective framework that dynamically improves the embedding model's representation learning for negative pairs based on their discriminative difficulty. Within this framework, we train a series of models, named LLaVE, and evaluate them on the MMEB benchmark, which covers 4 meta-tasks and 36 datasets. Experimental results show that LLaVE establishes stronger baselines that achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while demonstrating strong scalability and efficiency. Specifically, LLaVE-2B surpasses the previous SOTA 7B models, while LLaVE-7B achieves a further performance improvement of 6.2 points. Although LLaVE is trained on image-text data, it can generalize to text-video retrieval tasks in a zero-shot manner and achieve strong performance, demonstrating its remarkable potential for transfer to other embedding tasks.</p></details> | Preprint |

Narrative event descriptions provide context-rich information, enhancing a system's future planning and decision-making capabilities. We propose a novel task: $\textit{long-term future narration generation}$, which extends beyond traditional action anticipation by generating detailed narrations of future daily activities. We introduce a visual-language model, ViNa, specifically designed to address this challenging task. ViNa integrates long-term videos and corresponding narrations to generate a sequence of future narrations that predict subsequent events and actions over extended time horizons. ViNa extends existing multimodal models that perform only short-term predictions or describe observed videos by generating long-term future narrations for a broader range of daily activities. We also present a novel downstream application that leverages the generated narrations called future video retrieval to help users improve planning for a task by visualizing the future. We evaluate future narration generation on the largest egocentric dataset Ego4D.</p></details> |  |
| **[SHE-Net: Syntax-Hierarchy-Enhanced Text-Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14066v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The user base of short video apps has experienced unprecedented growth in recent years, resulting in a significant demand for video content analysis. In particular, text-video retrieval, which aims to find the top matching videos given text descriptions from a vast video corpus, is an essential function, the primary challenge of which is to bridge the modality gap. Nevertheless, most existing approaches treat texts merely as discrete tokens and neglect their syntax structures. Moreover, the abundant spatial and temporal clues in videos are often underutilized due to the lack of interaction with text. To address these issues, we argue that using texts as guidance to focus on relevant temporal frames and spatial regions within videos is beneficial. In this paper, we propose a novel Syntax-Hierarchy-Enhanced text-video retrieval method (SHE-Net) that exploits the inherent semantic and syntax hierarchy of texts to bridge the modality gap from two perspectives. First, to facilitate a more fine-grained integration of visual content, we employ the text syntax hierarchy, which reveals the grammatical structure of text descriptions, to guide the visual representations. Second, to further enhance the multi-modal interaction and alignment, we also utilize the syntax hierarchy to guide the similarity calculation. We evaluated our method on four public text-video retrieval datasets of MSR-VTT, MSVD, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet. The experimental results and ablation studies confirm the advantages of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

While prior work focuses on mitigating hallucinations, we instead explore leveraging hallucination correction as a training objective to improve video-language alignment. We introduce HACA, a self-training framework learning to correct hallucinations in descriptions that do not align with the video content. By identifying and correcting inconsistencies, HACA enhances the model's ability to align video and textual representations for spatio-temporal reasoning. Our experimental results show consistent gains in video-caption binding and text-to-video retrieval tasks, demonstrating that hallucination correction-inspired tasks serve as an effective strategy for improving vision and language alignment.</p></details> |  |

Most existing TVR methods are based on large-scale pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP). However, due to the inherent plain structure of CLIP, few TVR methods explore the multi-scale representations which offer richer contextual information for a more thorough understanding. To this end, we propose MUSE, a multi-scale mamba with linear computational complexity for efficient cross-resolution modeling. Specifically, the multi-scale representations are generated by applying a feature pyramid on the last single-scale feature map. Then, we employ the Mamba structure as an efficient multi-scale learner to jointly learn scale-wise representations. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive studies to investigate different model structures and designs. Extensive results on three popular benchmarks have validated the superiority of MUSE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, existing video retrieval datasets suffer from scope limitations, primarily focusing on matching descriptive but vague queries with small collections of professionally edited, English-centric videos. To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{MultiVENT 2.0}$, a large-scale, multilingual event-centric video retrieval benchmark featuring a collection of more than 218,000 news videos and 3,906 queries targeting specific world events. These queries specifically target information found in the visual content, audio, embedded text, and text metadata of the videos, requiring systems leverage all these sources to succeed at the task. Preliminary results show that state-of-the-art vision-language models struggle significantly with this task, and while alternative approaches show promise, they are still insufficient to adequately address this problem. These findings underscore the need for more robust multimodal retrieval systems, as effective video retrieval is a crucial step towards multimodal content understanding and generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Branch Collaborative Learning Network for Video Quality Assessment in Industrial Video Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05924v1)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Quality Assessment (VQA) is vital for large-scale video retrieval systems, aimed at identifying quality issues to prioritize high-quality videos. In industrial systems, low-quality video characteristics fall into four categories: visual-related issues like mosaics and black boxes, textual issues from video titles and OCR content, and semantic issues like frame incoherence and frame-text mismatch from AI-generated videos. Despite their prevalence in industrial settings, these low-quality videos have been largely overlooked in academic research, posing a challenge for accurate identification. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Branch Collaborative Network (MBCN) tailored for industrial video retrieval systems. MBCN features four branches, each designed to tackle one of the aforementioned quality issues. After each branch independently scores videos, we aggregate these scores using a weighted approach and a squeeze-and-excitation mechanism to dynamically address quality issues across different scenarios. We implement point-wise and pair-wise optimization objectives to ensure score stability and reasonableness. Extensive offline and online experiments on a world-level video search engine demonstrate MBCN's effectiveness in identifying video quality issues, significantly enhancing the retrieval system's ranking performance. Detailed experimental analyses confirm the positive contribution of all four evaluation branches. Furthermore, MBCN significantly improves recognition accuracy for low-quality AI-generated videos compared to the baseline.</p></details> | KDD 2025 ADS |

In this study, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model is used to annotate surveillance videos in an unsupervised manner. In scene understanding methods, some of the learned patterns are ambiguous and represents a mixture of atomic actions. To address the ambiguity issue in the proposed method, feature vectors, and the primary model are processed to obtain a secondary model which describes the scene with primitive patterns that lack any ambiguity. Experiments show performance improvement in the retrieval task compared to other topic model-based methods. In terms of false positive and true positive responses, the proposed method achieves at least 80\% and 124\% improvement respectively. Four search strategies are proposed, and users can define and search for a variety of activities using the proposed query formulation which is based on topic models. In addition, the lightweight database in our method occupies much fewer storage which in turn speeds up the search procedure compared to the methods which are based on low-level features.</p></details> |  |

As an important subfield, video-language representation learning focuses on learning representations using global semantic interactions between pre-defined video-text pairs. However, to enhance and refine such coarse-grained global interactions, more detailed interactions are necessary for fine-grained multimodal learning. In this study, we introduce a new approach that models video-text as game players using multivariate cooperative game theory to handle uncertainty during fine-grained semantic interactions with diverse granularity, flexible combination, and vague intensity. Specifically, we design the Hierarchical Banzhaf Interaction to simulate the fine-grained correspondence between video clips and textual words from hierarchical perspectives. Furthermore, to mitigate the bias in calculations within Banzhaf Interaction, we propose reconstructing the representation through a fusion of single-modal and cross-modal components. This reconstructed representation ensures fine granularity comparable to that of the single-modal representation, while also preserving the adaptive encoding characteristics of cross-modal representation. Additionally, we extend our original structure into a flexible encoder-decoder framework, enabling the model to adapt to various downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on commonly used text-video retrieval, video-question answering, and video captioning benchmarks, with superior performance, validate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2303.14369</p></details> |

However, identifying the best music for a video can be a difficult and time-consuming task. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for automatically retrieving a matching music clip for a given video, and vice versa. Our approach leverages annotated music labels, as well as the inherent artistic correspondence between visual and music elements. Distinct from previous cross-modal music retrieval works, our method combines both self-supervised and supervised training objectives. We use self-supervised and label-supervised contrastive learning to train a joint embedding space between music and video. We show the effectiveness of our approach by using music genre labels for the supervised training component, and our framework can be generalized to other music annotations (e.g., emotion, instrument, etc.). Furthermore, our method enables fine-grained control over how much the retrieval process focuses on self-supervised vs. label information at inference time. We evaluate the learned embeddings through a variety of video-to-music and music-to-video retrieval tasks. Our experiments show that the proposed approach successfully combines self-supervised and supervised objectives and is effective for controllable music-video retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

To address this problem, fine-tuning long-context LVLMs and employing GPT-based agents have emerged as promising solutions. However, fine-tuning LVLMs would require extensive high-quality data and substantial GPU resources, while GPT-based agents would rely on proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o). In this paper, we propose Video Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Video-RAG), a training-free and cost-effective pipeline that employs visually-aligned auxiliary texts to help facilitate cross-modality alignment while providing additional information beyond the visual content. Specifically, we leverage open-source external tools to extract visually-aligned information from pure video data (e.g., audio, optical character, and object detection), and incorporate the extracted information into an existing LVLM as auxiliary texts, alongside video frames and queries, in a plug-and-play manner. Our Video-RAG offers several key advantages: (i) lightweight with low computing overhead due to single-turn retrieval; (ii) easy implementation and compatibility with any LVLM; and (iii) significant, consistent performance gains across long video understanding benchmarks, including Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench. Notably, our model demonstrates superior performance over proprietary models like Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o when utilized with a 72B model.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

To better gain video contents, a new topic HIREST is presented, including video retrieval, moment retrieval, moment segmentation, and step-captioning. The pioneering work chooses the pre-trained CLIP-based model for video retrieval, and leverages it as a feature extractor for other three challenging tasks solved in a multi-task learning paradigm. Nevertheless, this work struggles to learn the comprehensive cognition of user-preferred content, due to disregarding the hierarchies and association relations across modalities. In this paper, guided by the shallow-to-deep principle, we propose a query-centric audio-visual cognition (QUAG) network to construct a reliable multi-modal representation for moment retrieval, segmentation and step-captioning. Specifically, we first design the modality-synergistic perception to obtain rich audio-visual content, by modeling global contrastive alignment and local fine-grained interaction between visual and audio modalities. Then, we devise the query-centric cognition that uses the deep-level query to perform the temporal-channel filtration on the shallow-level audio-visual representation. This can cognize user-preferred content and thus attain a query-centric audio-visual representation for three tasks. Extensive experiments show QUAG achieves the SOTA results on HIREST. Further, we test QUAG on the query-based video summarization task and verify its good generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Despite these advancements, achieving accurate matching in TVR remains challenging due to inherent disparities between video and textual modalities and irregularities in data representation. In this paper, we propose Text-Video-ProxyNet (TV-ProxyNet), a novel framework designed to decompose the conventional 1-to-N relationship of TVR into N distinct 1-to-1 relationships. By replacing a single text query with a series of text proxies, TV-ProxyNet not only broadens the query scope but also achieves a more precise expansion. Each text proxy is crafted through a refined iterative process, controlled by mechanisms we term as the director and dash, which regulate the proxy's direction and distance relative to the original text query. This setup not only facilitates more precise semantic alignment but also effectively manages the disparities and noise inherent in multimodal data. Our experiments on three representative video-text retrieval benchmarks, MSRVTT, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet Captions, demonstrate the effectiveness of TV-ProxyNet. The results show an improvement of 2.0% to 3.3% in R@1 over the baseline. TV-ProxyNet achieved state-of-the-art performance on MSRVTT and ActivityNet Captions, and a 2.0% improvement on DiDeMo compared to existing methods, validating our approach's ability to enhance semantic mapping and reduce error propensity.</p></details> |  |

Three popular SemCom systems enabled by classical GAI models are first introduced, including variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. For each system, the fundamental concept of the GAI model, the corresponding SemCom architecture, and the associated literature review of recent efforts are elucidated. Then, a novel generative SemCom system is proposed by incorporating the cutting-edge GAI technology-large language models (LLMs). This system features two LLM-based AI agents at both the transmitter and receiver, serving as "brains" to enable powerful information understanding and content regeneration capabilities, respectively. This innovative design allows the receiver to directly generate the desired content, instead of recovering the bit stream, based on the coded semantic information conveyed by the transmitter. Therefore, it shifts the communication mindset from "information recovery" to "information regeneration" and thus ushers in a new era of generative SemCom. A case study on point-to-point video retrieval is presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed generative SemCom system, showcasing a 99.98% reduction in communication overhead and a 53% improvement in retrieval accuracy compared to the traditional communication system. Furthermore, four typical application scenarios for generative SemCom are delineated, followed by a discussion of three open issues warranting future investigation. In a nutshell, this paper provides a holistic set of guidelines for applying GAI in SemCom, paving the way for the efficient implementation of generative SemCom in future wireless networks.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Multimodal Contextualized Support for Enhancing Video Retrieval System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07584v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video retrieval systems, especially those used in competitions, primarily focus on querying individual keyframes or images rather than encoding an entire clip or video segment. However, queries often describe an action or event over a series of frames, not a specific image. This results in insufficient information when analyzing a single frame, leading to less accurate query results. Moreover, extracting embeddings solely from images (keyframes) does not provide enough information for models to encode higher-level, more abstract insights inferred from the video. These models tend to only describe the objects present in the frame, lacking a deeper understanding. In this work, we propose a system that integrates the latest methodologies, introducing a novel pipeline that extracts multimodal data, and incorporate information from multiple frames within a video, enabling the model to abstract higher-level information that captures latent meanings, focusing on what can be inferred from the video clip, rather than just focusing on object detection in one single image.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

This neglects the richness and variety of possible valid descriptions of a video, which could range anywhere from moment-by-moment detail to a single phrase summary. To provide a more thorough evaluation of the capabilities of long video retrieval systems, we propose a pipeline that leverages state-of-the-art large language models to carefully generate a diverse set of synthetic captions for long videos. We validate this pipeline's fidelity via rigorous human inspection. We use synthetic captions from this pipeline to perform a benchmark of a representative set of video language models using long video datasets, and show that the models struggle on shorter captions. We show that finetuning on this data can both mitigate these issues (+2.8% R@1 over SOTA on ActivityNet with diverse captions), and even improve performance on standard paragraph-to-video retrieval (+1.0% R@1 on ActivityNet). We also use synthetic data from our pipeline as query expansion in the zero-shot setting (+3.4% R@1 on ActivityNet). We derive insights by analyzing failure cases for retrieval with short captions.

Most CoIR approaches require manually annotated datasets, comprising image-text-image triplets, where the text describes a modification from the query image to the target image. However, manual curation of CoIR triplets is expensive and prevents scalability. In this work, we instead propose a scalable automatic dataset creation methodology that generates triplets given video-caption pairs, while also expanding the scope of the task to include composed video retrieval (CoVR). To this end, we mine paired videos with a similar caption from a large database, and leverage a large language model to generate the corresponding modification text. Applying this methodology to the extensive WebVid2M collection, we automatically construct our WebVid-CoVR dataset, resulting in 1.6 million triplets. Moreover, we introduce a new benchmark for CoVR with a manually annotated evaluation set, along with baseline results. We further validate that our methodology is equally applicable to image-caption pairs, by generating 3.3 million CoIR training triplets using the Conceptual Captions dataset. Our model builds on BLIP-2 pretraining, adapting it to composed video (or image) retrieval, and incorporates an additional caption retrieval loss to exploit extra supervision beyond the triplet. We provide extensive ablations to analyze the design choices on our new CoVR benchmark. Our experiments also demonstrate that training a CoVR model on our datasets effectively transfers to CoIR, leading to improved state-of-the-art performance in the zero-shot setup on the CIRR, FashionIQ, and CIRCO benchmarks.

Recent advancements in text-video retrieval have focused on cross-modal interactions, large-scale foundation model training, and probabilistic modeling, yet often neglect the crucial user perspective, leading to discrepancies between user queries and the content retrieved. To address this, we introduce MERLIN (Multimodal Embedding Refinement via LLM-based Iterative Navigation), a novel, training-free pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for iterative feedback learning. MERLIN refines query embeddings from a user perspective, enhancing alignment between queries and video content through a dynamic question answering process.

However, video-text pairs in previous data typically do not align perfectly with each other, which might lead to video-language representations that do not accurately reflect cross-modal semantics. Moreover, previous data also possess an uneven distribution of concepts, thereby hampering the downstream performance across unpopular subjects. To address these problems, we propose MAMA, a new approach to learning video-language representations by utilizing a contrastive objective with a subtractive angular margin to regularize cross-modal representations in their effort to reach perfect similarity. Furthermore, to adapt to the non-uniform concept distribution, MAMA utilizes a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-parameterized weighting function that maps loss values to sample weights which enable dynamic adjustment of the model's focus throughout the training. With the training guided by a small amount of unbiased meta-data and augmented by video-text data generated by large vision-language model, MAMA improves video-language representations and achieve superior performances on commonly used video question answering and text-video retrieval datasets.

In light of this, ideal text-to-image (T2I) retrievers should prioritize specific visual attributes relevant to queries. To evaluate current retrievers on handling attribute-focused queries, we build COCO-Facet, a COCO-based benchmark with 9,112 queries about diverse attributes of interest. We find that CLIP-like retrievers, which are widely adopted due to their efficiency and zero-shot ability, have poor and imbalanced performance, possibly because their image embeddings focus on global semantics and subjects while leaving out other details. Notably, we reveal that even recent Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based, stronger retrievers with a larger output dimension struggle with this limitation. Hence, we hypothesize that retrieving with general image embeddings is suboptimal for performing such queries. As a solution, we propose to use promptable image embeddings enabled by these multimodal retrievers, which boost performance by highlighting required attributes. Our pipeline for deriving such embeddings generalizes across query types, image pools, and base retriever architectures. To enhance real-world applicability, we offer two acceleration strategies: Pre-processing promptable embeddings and using linear approximations. We show that the former yields a 15% improvement in Recall@5 when prompts are predefined, while the latter achieves an 8% improvement when prompts are only available during inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025; 27 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[PRISM: Enhancing Protein Inverse Folding through Fine-Grained Retrieval on Structure-Sequence Multimodal Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11750v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing protein sequences that fold into a target three-dimensional structure, known as the inverse folding problem, is central to protein engineering but remains challenging due to the vast sequence space and the importance of local structural constraints. Existing deep learning approaches achieve strong recovery rates, yet they lack explicit mechanisms to reuse fine-grained structure-sequence patterns that are conserved across natural proteins. We present PRISM, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation framework for inverse folding that retrieves fine-grained representations of potential motifs from known proteins and integrates them with a hybrid self-cross attention decoder. PRISM is formulated as a latent-variable probabilistic model and implemented with an efficient approximation, combining theoretical grounding with practical scalability. Across five benchmarks (CATH-4.2, TS50, TS500, CAMEO 2022, and the PDB date split), PRISM establishes new state of the art in both perplexity and amino acid recovery, while also improving foldability metrics (RMSD, TM-score, pLDDT), demonstrating that fine-grained multimodal retrieval is a powerful and efficient paradigm for protein sequence design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lightweight Joint Optimization of General-Purpose Vision-Language Models and Retrievers for RAG-Based Medical Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17394v3)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieving relevant visual and textual information from medical literature and hospital records can enhance diagnostic accuracy for clinical image interpretation. We develop a multimodal retrieval model jointly optimized with an LVLM for medical diagnosis, unlike standard RAG which doesn't backpropagate LVLM errors to the retriever. Using only general-purpose backbones with lightweight fine-tuning, our model achieves competitive results with medically-pretrained models on clinical classification and VQA tasks. In a novel analysis, we find that different top-retrieved images often yield different predictions for the same target, and that these cases are challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval models. Our joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these cases over standard RAG. However, oracle analysis reveals that while the correct diagnosis is frequently achievable using one of the top retrieved images, in practice there is a large performance gap from the oracle, and rerankers using frontier LVLMs do not close this gap -- leaving ample room for improvement by future methods.

| **[MRMR: A Realistic and Expert-Level Multidisciplinary Benchmark for Reasoning-Intensive Multimodal Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09510v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MRMR, the first expert-level multidisciplinary multimodal retrieval benchmark requiring intensive reasoning. MRMR contains 1,502 queries spanning 23 domains, with positive documents carefully verified by human experts. Compared to prior benchmarks, MRMR introduces three key advancements. First, it challenges retrieval systems across diverse areas of expertise, enabling fine-grained model comparison across domains. Second, queries are reasoning-intensive, with images requiring deeper interpretation such as diagnosing microscopic slides. We further introduce Contradiction Retrieval, a novel task requiring models to identify conflicting concepts. Finally, queries and documents are constructed as image-text interleaved sequences. Unlike earlier benchmarks restricted to single images or unimodal documents, MRMR offers a realistic setting with multi-image queries and mixed-modality corpus documents. We conduct an extensive evaluation of 4 categories of multimodal retrieval systems and 14 frontier models on MRMR. The text embedding model Qwen3-Embedding with LLM-generated image captions achieves the highest performance, highlighting substantial room for improving multimodal retrieval models. Although latest multimodal models such as Ops-MM-Embedding perform competitively on expert-domain queries, they fall short on reasoning-intensive tasks. We believe that MRMR paves the way for advancing multimodal retrieval in more realistic and challenging scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robustness in Both Domains: CLIP Needs a Robust Text Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03355v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial input attacks can cause a significant shift of CLIP embeddings. This can affect the downstream robustness of models incorporating CLIP in the pipeline, such as text-to-image generative models or large vision language models. While some efforts have been done towards making the CLIP image encoders robust, the robustness of text encoders remains unexplored. In this work, we cover this gap in the literature. We propose LEAF: an efficient adversarial finetuning method for the text domain, with the ability to scale to large CLIP models. Our models significantly improve the zero-shot adversarial accuracy in the text domain, while maintaining the vision performance provided by robust image encoders. When combined with text-to-image diffusion models, we can improve the generation quality under adversarial noise. In multimodal retrieval tasks, LEAF improves the recall under adversarial noise over standard CLIP models. Finally, we show that robust text encoders facilitate better reconstruction of input text from its embedding via direct optimization. We open-source our code ( https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/LEAF ) and models ( https://huggingface.co/LEAF-CLIP ).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[CFVBench: A Comprehensive Video Benchmark for Fine-grained Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09266v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) enables Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate responses with external multimodal evidence, and numerous video-based MRAG benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate model capabilities across retrieval and generation stages. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in modality coverage and format diversity, often focusing on single- or limited-modality tasks, or coarse-grained scene understanding. To address these gaps, we introduce CFVBench, a large-scale, manually verified benchmark constructed from 599 publicly available videos, yielding 5,360 open-ended QA pairs. CFVBench spans high-density formats and domains such as chart-heavy reports, news broadcasts, and software tutorials, requiring models to retrieve and reason over long temporal video spans while maintaining fine-grained multimodal information. Using CFVBench, we systematically evaluate 7 retrieval methods and 14 widely-used MLLMs, revealing a critical bottleneck: current models (even GPT5 or Gemini) struggle to capture transient yet essential fine-grained multimodal details. To mitigate this, we propose Adaptive Visual Refinement (AVR), a simple yet effective framework that adaptively increases frame sampling density and selectively invokes external tools when necessary. Experiments show that AVR consistently enhances fine-grained multimodal comprehension and improves performance across all evaluated MLLMs</p></details> |  |
| **[UNIDOC-BENCH: A Unified Benchmark for Document-Centric Multimodal RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03663v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) is a key approach for applying large language models (LLMs) and agents to real-world knowledge bases, yet current evaluations are fragmented, focusing on either text or images in isolation or on simplified multimodal setups that fail to capture document-centric multimodal use cases. In this paper, we introduce UniDoc-Bench, the first large-scale, realistic benchmark for MM-RAG built from 70k real-world PDF pages across eight domains. Our pipeline extracts and links evidence from text, tables, and figures, then generates 1,600 multimodal QA pairs spanning factual retrieval, comparison, summarization, and logical reasoning queries. To ensure reliability, 20% of QA pairs are validated by multiple annotators and expert adjudication. UniDoc-Bench supports apples-to-apples comparison across four paradigms: (1) text-only, (2) image-only, (3) multimodal text-image fusion, and (4) multimodal joint retrieval -- under a unified protocol with standardized candidate pools, prompts, and evaluation metrics. Our experiments show that multimodal text-image fusion RAG systems consistently outperform both unimodal and jointly multimodal embedding-based retrieval, indicating that neither text nor images alone are sufficient and that current multimodal embeddings remain inadequate. Beyond benchmarking, our analysis reveals when and how visual context complements textual evidence, uncovers systematic failure modes, and offers actionable guidance for developing more robust MM-RAG pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[M3Retrieve: Benchmarking Multimodal Retrieval for Medicine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06888v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing use of RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG), strong retrieval models have become more important than ever. In healthcare, multimodal retrieval models that combine information from both text and images offer major advantages for many downstream tasks such as question answering, cross-modal retrieval, and multimodal summarization, since medical data often includes both formats. However, there is currently no standard benchmark to evaluate how well these models perform in medical settings. To address this gap, we introduce M3Retrieve, a Multimodal Medical Retrieval Benchmark. M3Retrieve, spans 5 domains,16 medical fields, and 4 distinct tasks, with over 1.2 Million text documents and 164K multimodal queries, all collected under approved licenses. We evaluate leading multimodal retrieval models on this benchmark to explore the challenges specific to different medical specialities and to understand their impact on retrieval performance. By releasing M3Retrieve, we aim to enable systematic evaluation, foster model innovation, and accelerate research toward building more capable and reliable multimodal retrieval systems for medical applications. The dataset and the baselines code are available in this github page https://github.com/AkashGhosh/M3Retrieve.</p></details> | EMNLP Mains 2025 |
| **[Efficient Discriminative Joint Encoders for Large Scale Vision-Language Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06820v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval still leans on embedding-based models like CLIP for fast vector search over pre-computed image embeddings. Yet, unlike text retrieval, where joint-encoder rerankers are standard, comparable vision--language rerankers are largely absent. We find that seminal joint encoders such as BLIP are severely bottlenecked by an expensive visual feature-extraction stage, preventing practical deployment at scale. Motivated by this bottleneck, we introduce EDJE, an Efficient Discriminative Joint Encoder that precomputes vision tokens offline and compresses them via a lightweight attention-based adapter, so online inference runs only a compact joint encoder over a small set of visual tokens plus the text. EDJE preserves strong retrieval performance while drastically reducing storage and online compute, enabling high-throughput inference. Specifically, EDJE processes 50k image--text pairs/second while requiring 49kB of disk storage per image, matching prior art on Flickr (zero-shot) and COCO (fine-tuned) retrieval. The implementation and checkpoints will be made publicly available shortly.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Guided Query Refinement: Multimodal Hybrid Retrieval with Test-Time Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05038v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal encoders have pushed the boundaries of visual document retrieval, matching textual query tokens directly to image patches and achieving state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks. Recent models relying on this paradigm have massively scaled the sizes of their query and document representations, presenting obstacles to deployment and scalability in real-world pipelines. Furthermore, purely vision-centric approaches may be constrained by the inherent modality gap still exhibited by modern vision-language models. In this work, we connect these challenges to the paradigm of hybrid retrieval, investigating whether a lightweight dense text retriever can enhance a stronger vision-centric model. Existing hybrid methods, which rely on coarse-grained fusion of ranks or scores, fail to exploit the rich interactions within each model's representation space. To address this, we introduce Guided Query Refinement (GQR), a novel test-time optimization method that refines a primary retriever's query embedding using guidance from a complementary retriever's scores. Through extensive experiments on visual document retrieval benchmarks, we demonstrate that GQR allows vision-centric models to match the performance of models with significantly larger representations, while being up to 14x faster and requiring 54x less memory. Our findings show that GQR effectively pushes the Pareto frontier for performance and efficiency in multimodal retrieval. We release our code at https://github.com/IBM/test-time-hybrid-retrieval</p></details> |  |

While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced language models by incorporating external knowledge, existing text-based retrievers rely on clean, structured input and struggle with the visually and semantically rich content found in real-world documents such as PDFs, slides, or videos. Recent work such as ColPali has shown that preserving document layout using image-based representations can improve retrieval quality. Building on this, and inspired by the capabilities of recent multimodal models such as Qwen2.5-Omni, we extend retrieval beyond text and images to also support audio and video modalities. Omni-Embed-Nemotron enables both cross-modal (e.g., text - video) and joint-modal (e.g., text - video+audio) retrieval using a single model. We describe the architecture, training setup, and evaluation results of Omni-Embed-Nemotron, and demonstrate its effectiveness in text, image, and video retrieval.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes, and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved. Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1 achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability, as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Existing benchmarks primarily probe surface-level semantic correspondence (e.g., object-text matching) while failing to assess the deeper reasoning required to capture complex relationships between visual and textual information. To address this gap, we introduce MR$^2$-Bench, a reasoning-intensive benchmark for multimodal retrieval. MR$^2$-Bench presents the following critical values: 1) all tasks are reasoning-driven, going beyond shallow matching to effectively assess models' capacity for logical, spatial, and causal inference; 2) it features diverse multimodal data, such as natural images, diagrams, and visual puzzles, enabling comprehensive evaluation across content types; 3) it supports complex queries and documents containing multiple images and covers diverse retrieval scenarios, more accurately reflecting real-world applications. Our benchmark contains 1,309 curated queries, derived either from manual collection and annotation or from selective consolidation of public datasets. Despite achieving strong results on existing benchmarks, current state-of-the-art models still struggle on MR$^2$-Bench: for example, the leading Seed1.6-Embedding model attains a Recall@1 of 77.78 on MMEB, but only 9.91 on MR$^2$-Bench. This substantial performance gap highlights both the increased challenge posed by our benchmark and the pressing need for further advances in reasoning-intensive multimodal retrieval. The dataset and evaluation code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/MR2-Bench.</p></details> |  |

To address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation. Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP) using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

| **[Provenance Analysis of Archaeological Artifacts via Multimodal RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20769v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based system for provenance analysis of archaeological artifacts, designed to support expert reasoning by integrating multimodal retrieval and large vision-language models (VLMs). The system constructs a dual-modal knowledge base from reference texts and images, enabling raw visual, edge-enhanced, and semantic retrieval to identify stylistically similar objects. Retrieved candidates are synthesized by the VLM to generate structured inferences, including chronological, geographical, and cultural attributions, alongside interpretive justifications. We evaluate the system on a set of Eastern Eurasian Bronze Age artifacts from the British Museum. Expert evaluation demonstrates that the system produces meaningful and interpretable outputs, offering scholars concrete starting points for analysis and significantly alleviating the cognitive burden of navigating vast comparative corpora.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation, prevailing methods remain limited: (i) reasoning is frequently neither clinically interpretable nor aligned with guidelines, reflecting mere aggregation of tool outputs; (ii) multimodal evidence is insufficiently fused, yielding text-only rationales that are not visually grounded; and (iii) systems rarely detect or resolve cross-tool inconsistencies and provide no principled verification mechanisms. To bridge the above gaps, we present RadAgents, a multi-agent framework for CXR interpretation that couples clinical priors with task-aware multimodal reasoning. In addition, we integrate grounding and multimodal retrieval-augmentation to verify and resolve context conflicts, resulting in outputs that are more reliable, transparent, and consistent with clinical practice.</p></details> | In progress |

Users frequently struggle to express their complaints clearly in text but can easily upload videos depicting product defects (e.g., vague text such as `worst product' paired with a 5-second video depicting a broken headphone with the right earcup). This paper formulates a new task in the field of complaint mining to aid the common users' need to write an expressive complaint, which is Complaint Description from Videos (CoD-V) (e.g., to help the above user articulate her complaint about the defective right earcup). To this end, we introduce ComVID, a video complaint dataset containing 1,175 complaint videos and the corresponding descriptions, also annotated with the emotional state of the complainer. Additionally, we present a new complaint retention (CR) evaluation metric that discriminates the proposed (CoD-V) task against standard video summary generation and description tasks. To strengthen this initiative, we introduce a multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) embedded VideoLLaMA2-7b model, designed to generate complaints while accounting for the user's emotional state. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of several Video Language Models on several tasks (pre-trained and fine-tuned versions) with a range of established evaluation metrics, including METEOR, perplexity, and the Coleman-Liau readability score, among others. Our study lays the foundation for a new research direction to provide a platform for users to express complaints through video.

However, their high technical entry barrier limits accessibility for non-expert users. This study presents an open-source conversational assistant that integrates multimodal retrieval and large language models (LLMs) to enable natural language interaction with heterogeneous agricultural and geospatial data. The proposed architecture combines orthophotos, Sentinel-2 vegetation indices, and user-provided documents through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), allowing the system to flexibly determine whether to rely on multimodal evidence, textual knowledge, or both in formulating an answer. To assess response quality, we adopt an LLM-as-a-judge methodology using Qwen3-32B in a zero-shot, unsupervised setting, applying direct scoring in a multi-dimensional quantitative evaluation framework. Preliminary results show that the system is capable of generating clear, relevant, and context-aware responses to agricultural queries, while remaining reproducible and scalable across geographic regions. The primary contributions of this work include an architecture for fusing multimodal EO and textual knowledge sources, a demonstration of lowering the barrier to access specialized agricultural information through natural language interaction, and an open and reproducible design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 4th International Conference on Geographic Information and Remote Sensing Technology</p></details> |

However, current methods either condense queries and candidates into a single vector, potentially limiting the expressiveness for fine-grained information, or produce too many vectors that are prohibitively expensive for multi-vector retrieval. In this work, we introduce MetaEmbed, a new framework for multimodal retrieval that rethinks how multimodal embeddings are constructed and interacted with at scale. During training, a fixed number of learnable Meta Tokens are appended to the input sequence. At test-time, their last-layer contextualized representations serve as compact yet expressive multi-vector embeddings. Through the proposed Matryoshka Multi-Vector Retrieval training, MetaEmbed learns to organize information by granularity across multiple vectors. As a result, we enable test-time scaling in multimodal retrieval, where users can balance retrieval quality against efficiency demands by selecting the number of tokens used for indexing and retrieval interactions. Extensive evaluations on the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (MMEB) and the Visual Document Retrieval Benchmark (ViDoRe) confirm that MetaEmbed achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance while scaling robustly to models with 32B parameters.</p></details> |  |

However, this approach merely reuses the Key-Value (KV) cache of the initial sequence of prompt, resulting in full KV cache recomputation even if the prefix differs slightly. This becomes particularly inefficient in the context of interleaved text and images, as well as multimodal retrieval-augmented generation. This paper proposes position-independent caching as a more effective approach for multimodal information management. We have designed and implemented a caching system, named MPIC, to address both system-level and algorithm-level challenges. MPIC stores the KV cache on local disks when receiving multimodal data, and calculates and loads the KV cache in parallel during inference. To mitigate accuracy degradation, we have incorporated the integrated reuse and recompute mechanism within the system. The experimental results demonstrate that MPIC can achieve up to 54\% reduction in response time and 2$\times$ improvement in throughput compared to existing context caching systems, while maintaining negligible or no accuracy loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 13 figures, the second version</p></details> |

Casting ranking as lossy source coding, we derive a single-letter rate-distortion function $R(D)$ for reciprocal-rank distortion and prove a converse bound that splits into a modality-balanced term plus a skew penalty $\kappa\,\Delta H$ capturing entropy imbalance and cross-modal redundancy. We then construct an explicit entropy-weighted stochastic quantizer with an adaptive, per-modality temperature decoder; a Blahut-Arimoto argument shows this scheme achieves distortion within $O(n^{-1})$ of $R(D)$ using $n$ training triples. A VC-type analysis yields the first finite-sample excess-risk bound whose complexity scales sub-linearly in both the number of modalities and the entropy gap. Experiments on controlled Gaussian mixtures and Flickr30k confirm that our adaptive codes sit within two percentage points of the theoretical frontier, while fixed-temperature and naive CLIP baselines lag significantly. Taken together, our results give a principled answer to "how many bits per query are necessary" for high-quality multimodal retrieval and provide design guidance for entropy-aware contrastive objectives, continual-learning retrievers, and retrieval-augmented generators.</p></details> | ICCV MRR 2025 |

However, these models face critical challenges when deployed in real-world applications, including hallucination generation, outdated knowledge, and limited domain expertise. Retrieval And Structuring (RAS) Augmented Generation addresses these limitations by integrating dynamic information retrieval with structured knowledge representations. This survey (1) examines retrieval mechanisms including sparse, dense, and hybrid approaches for accessing external knowledge; (2) explore text structuring techniques such as taxonomy construction, hierarchical classification, and information extraction that transform unstructured text into organized representations; and (3) investigate how these structured representations integrate with LLMs through prompt-based methods, reasoning frameworks, and knowledge embedding techniques. It also identifies technical challenges in retrieval efficiency, structure quality, and knowledge integration, while highlighting research opportunities in multimodal retrieval, cross-lingual structures, and interactive systems.

The effectiveness of Vision-language RAG systems hinges on multimodal retrieval, which is inherently challenging due to the diverse modalities and knowledge granularities in both queries and knowledge bases. Existing methods have not fully tapped into the potential interplay between these elements. We propose a multimodal RAG system featuring a coarse-to-fine, multi-step retrieval that harmonizes multiple granularities and modalities to enhance efficacy. Our system begins with a broad initial search aligning knowledge granularity for cross-modal retrieval, followed by a multimodal fusion reranking to capture the nuanced multimodal information for top entity selection. A text reranker then filters out the most relevant fine-grained section for augmented generation. Extensive experiments on the InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA benchmarks show our method achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance and highly competitive answering results, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing KB-VQA systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents. In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets.

| **[A Multimodal RAG Framework for Housing Damage Assessment: Collaborative Optimization of Image Encoding and Policy Vector Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09721v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>After natural disasters, accurate evaluations of damage to housing are important for insurance claims response and planning of resources. In this work, we introduce a novel multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) framework. On top of classical RAG architecture, we further the framework to devise a two-branch multimodal encoder structure that the image branch employs a visual encoder composed of ResNet and Transformer to extract the characteristic of building damage after disaster, and the text branch harnesses a BERT retriever for the text vectorization of posts as well as insurance policies and for the construction of a retrievable restoration index. To impose cross-modal semantic alignment, the model integrates a cross-modal interaction module to bridge the semantic representation between image and text via multi-head attention. Meanwhile, in the generation module, the introduced modal attention gating mechanism dynamically controls the role of visual evidence and text prior information during generation. The entire framework takes end-to-end training, and combines the comparison loss, the retrieval loss and the generation loss to form multi-task optimization objectives, and achieves image understanding and policy matching in collaborative learning. The results demonstrate superior performance in retrieval accuracy and classification index on damage severity, where the Top-1 retrieval accuracy has been improved by 9.6%.</p></details> |  |

Using over 3,600 digitized textbook pages largely from computer science textbooks and a Vision Language Model (VLM), we generate multi-vector representations capturing both textual and visual semantics. These embeddings are stored in a vector database. We issue a benchmark of 75 natural language queries and compare retrieval performance to ground truth and across four similarity (distance) measures. The study is intended to expose both the strengths and weakenesses of such an approach. We find that cosine similarity most effectively retrieves semantically and visually relevant pages. We further discuss the practicality of using a vector database and multi-modal embedding for operational information retrieval. Our paper is intended to offer design insights for discovery over digital libraries.

| **[PS-ReID: Advancing Person Re-Identification and Precise Segmentation with Multimodal Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21595v2)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (ReID) plays a critical role in applications such as security surveillance and criminal investigations. Most traditional image-based ReID methods face challenges including occlusions and lighting changes, while text provides complementary information to mitigate these issues. However, the integration of both image and text modalities remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose {\bf PS-ReID}, a multimodal model that combines image and text inputs to enhance ReID performance. In contrast to existing ReID methods limited by cropped pedestrian images, our PS-ReID focuses on full-scene settings and introduces a multimodal ReID task that incorporates segmentation, enabling precise feature extraction of the queried individual, even under challenging conditions such as occlusion. To this end, our model adopts a dual-path asymmetric encoding scheme that explicitly separates query and target roles: the query branch captures identity-discriminative cues, while the target branch performs holistic scene reasoning. Additionally, a token-level ReID loss supervises identity-aware tokens, coupling retrieval and segmentation to yield masks that are both spatially precise and identity-consistent. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we construct M2ReID, currently the largest full-scene multimodal ReID dataset, with over 200K images and 4,894 identities, featuring multimodal queries and high-quality segmentation masks. Experimental results demonstrate that PS-ReID significantly outperforms unimodal query-based models in both ReID and segmentation tasks. The model excels in challenging real-world scenarios such as occlusion, low lighting, and background clutter, offering a robust and flexible solution for person retrieval and segmentation. All code, models, and datasets will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Conventional vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search, Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding.

Among these, multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications are promising because they combine the strengths of information retrieval and generative models, enhancing their utility across various domains, including clinical use cases. This paper introduces AlzheimerRAG, a Multimodal RAG application for clinical use cases, primarily focusing on Alzheimer's Disease case studies from PubMed articles. This application incorporates cross-modal attention fusion techniques to integrate textual and visual data processing by efficiently indexing and accessing vast amounts of biomedical literature. Our experimental results, compared to benchmarks such as BioASQ and PubMedQA, have yielded improved performance in the retrieval and synthesis of domain-specific information. We also present a case study using our multimodal RAG in various Alzheimer's clinical scenarios. We infer that AlzheimerRAG can generate responses with accuracy non-inferior to humans and with low rates of hallucination.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks focus on English-only document retrieval or only consider multilingual question-answering on a single-page image. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisR-Bench, a multilingual benchmark designed for question-driven multimodal retrieval in long documents. Our benchmark comprises over 35K high-quality QA pairs across 1.2K documents, enabling fine-grained evaluation of multimodal retrieval. VisR-Bench spans sixteen languages with three question types (figures, text, and tables), offering diverse linguistic and question coverage. Unlike prior datasets, we include queries without explicit answers, preventing models from relying on superficial keyword matching. We evaluate various retrieval models, including text-based methods, multimodal encoders, and MLLMs, providing insights into their strengths and limitations. Our results show that while MLLMs significantly outperform text-based and multimodal encoder models, they still struggle with structured tables and low-resource languages, highlighting key challenges in multilingual visual retrieval.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Zero-shot Multimodal Document Retrieval via Cross-modal Question Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17079v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have expanded information retrieval beyond purely textual inputs, enabling retrieval from complex real world documents that combine text and visuals. However, most documents are private either owned by individuals or confined within corporate silos and current retrievers struggle when faced with unseen domains or languages. To address this gap, we introduce PREMIR, a simple yet effective framework that leverages the broad knowledge of an MLLM to generate cross modal pre questions (preQs) before retrieval. Unlike earlier multimodal retrievers that compare embeddings in a single vector space, PREMIR leverages preQs from multiple complementary modalities to expand the scope of matching to the token level. Experiments show that PREMIR achieves state of the art performance on out of distribution benchmarks, including closed domain and multilingual settings, outperforming strong baselines across all retrieval metrics. We confirm the contribution of each component through in depth ablation studies, and qualitative analyses of the generated preQs further highlight the model's robustness in real world settings.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce UniECS, a unified multimodal e-commerce search framework that handles all retrieval scenarios across image, text, and their combinations. Our work makes three key contributions. First, we propose a flexible architecture with a novel gated multimodal encoder that uses adaptive fusion mechanisms. This encoder integrates different modality representations while handling missing modalities. Second, we develop a comprehensive training strategy to optimize learning. It combines cross-modal alignment loss (CMAL), cohesive local alignment loss (CLAL), intra-modal contrastive loss (IMCL), and adaptive loss weighting. Third, we create M-BEER, a carefully curated multimodal benchmark containing 50K product pairs for e-commerce search evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniECS consistently outperforms existing methods across four e-commerce benchmarks with fine-tuning or zero-shot evaluation. On our M-BEER bench, UniECS achieves substantial improvements in cross-modal tasks (up to 28\% gain in R@10 for text-to-image retrieval) while maintaining parameter efficiency (0.2B parameters) compared to larger models like GME-Qwen2VL (2B) and MM-Embed (8B). Furthermore, we deploy UniECS in the e-commerce search platform of Kuaishou Inc. across two search scenarios, achieving notable improvements in Click-Through Rate (+2.74\%) and Revenue (+8.33\%). The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in both experimental and real-world settings.

To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-BrowseComp, a novel benchmark comprising 224 challenging, hand-crafted questions specifically designed to assess agents' multimodal retrieval and reasoning capabilities. These questions often incorporate images in prompts, and crucial information encountered during the search and reasoning process may also be embedded within images or videos on webpages. Consequently, methods relying solely on text prove insufficient for our benchmark. Additionally, we provide a verified checklist for each question, enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal dependencies and reasoning paths. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on MM-BrowseComp reveals that even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieve only 29.02\% accuracy, highlighting the suboptimal multimodal capabilities and lack of native multimodal reasoning in current models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contribute equally, 26 pages, repo at https://github.com/MMBrowseComp/MM-BrowseComp</p></details> |

However, their use as writing assistants in specialized domains like finance, medicine, and law is often hampered by a lack of deep domain-specific knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. Existing solutions, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), can suffer from inconsistency across multiple retrieval steps, while online search-based methods often degrade quality due to unreliable web content. To address these challenges, we introduce DeepWriter, a customizable, multimodal, long-form writing assistant that operates on a curated, offline knowledge base. DeepWriter leverages a novel pipeline that involves task decomposition, outline generation, multimodal retrieval, and section-by-section composition with reflection. By deeply mining information from a structured corpus and incorporating both textual and visual elements, DeepWriter generates coherent, factually grounded, and professional-grade documents. We also propose a hierarchical knowledge representation to enhance retrieval efficiency and accuracy. Our experiments on financial report generation demonstrate that DeepWriter produces high-quality, verifiable articles that surpasses existing baselines in factual accuracy and generated content quality.</p></details> | work in process |

Auditing Membership Leakage in Semi-Black-box RAG Controlling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09105v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) significantly improve the knowledge coverage and contextual understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing external knowledge sources. However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance, rendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute generated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus undermining privacy leakage accountability To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership Audit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content in a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities. To address the environmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an attribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which robustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through large-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition, SMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs into textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the text modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on image retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of membership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the content is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data provenance in complex generative systems.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often suffer from rigid retrieval strategies and under-utilization of visual information. To bridge this gap, we propose E-Agent, an agent framework featuring two key innovations: a mRAG planner trained to dynamically orchestrate multimodal tools based on contextual reasoning, and a task executor employing tool-aware execution sequencing to implement optimized mRAG workflows. E-Agent adopts a one-time mRAG planning strategy that enables efficient information retrieval while minimizing redundant tool invocations. To rigorously assess the planning capabilities of mRAG systems, we introduce the Real-World mRAG Planning (RemPlan) benchmark. This novel benchmark contains both retrieval-dependent and retrieval-independent question types, systematically annotated with essential retrieval tools required for each instance. The benchmark's explicit mRAG planning annotations and diverse question design enhance its practical relevance by simulating real-world scenarios requiring dynamic mRAG decisions. Experiments across RemPlan and three established benchmarks demonstrate E-Agent's superiority: 13% accuracy gain over state-of-the-art mRAG methods while reducing redundant searches by 37%.</p></details> |  |

Although significant progress has been made in cross-modal interaction, it remains a challenge due to the insufficient reference context in cross-modal interactions. Current cross-modal approaches primarily focus on leveraging modality-level reference context within a individual sample for cross-modal feature enhancement, neglecting the potential cross-sample relationships that can serve as sample-level reference context to enhance the cross-modal features. To address this issue, we propose a novel multimodal retrieval-augmented framework to simultaneously incorporate inter-sample modality-level reference context and cross-sample sample-level reference context to enhance the multimodal features. In particular, we first design a contrastive cross-modal retrieval module to retrieve semantic similar samples and enhance target modality. To endow the model to capture both inter-sample and intra-sample information, we integrate two different types of prompts, modality-level prompts and sample-level prompts, to generate modality-level and sample-level reference contexts, respectively. Finally, we design a cross-modal retrieval-augmented encoder that simultaneously leverages modality-level and sample-level reference contexts to enhance the target modality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our model on two publicly available datasets.</p></details> | Under review |

In contrast, real-world applications often demand both multimodal inputs and multimodal outputs for effective communication and grounded reasoning. Motivated by the recent success of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in complex reasoning tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs), we adopt RL as a principled and effective paradigm to address the multi-step, outcome-driven challenges inherent in multimodal output generation. Here, we introduce M2IO-R1, a novel framework for Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Generation (MRAMG) that supports both multimodal inputs and outputs. Central to our framework is an RL-based inserter, Inserter-R1-3B, trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization to guide image selection and placement in a controllable and semantically aligned manner.

Various explanation methods have been proposed to visualize the importance of input image-text pairs on the model's similarity outputs. However, popular saliency maps are limited by capturing only first-order attributions, overlooking the complex cross-modal interactions intrinsic to such encoders. We introduce faithful interaction explanations of LIP models (FIxLIP) as a unified approach to decomposing the similarity in vision-language encoders. FIxLIP is rooted in game theory, where we analyze how using the weighted Banzhaf interaction index offers greater flexibility and improves computational efficiency over the Shapley interaction quantification framework. From a practical perspective, we propose how to naturally extend explanation evaluation metrics, like the pointing game and area between the insertion/deletion curves, to second-order interaction explanations. Experiments on MS COCO and ImageNet-1k benchmarks validate that second-order methods like FIxLIP outperform first-order attribution methods. Beyond delivering high-quality explanations, we demonstrate the utility of FIxLIP in comparing different models like CLIP vs. SigLIP-2 and ViT-B/32 vs. ViT-L/16.</p></details> | Preprint |

Despite impressive advancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents and overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently introduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and reliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the generation by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework (mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks. Specifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and vision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned entities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality multimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a dual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal retriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for knowledge-based VQA.</p></details> |  |

Recent works mostly finetuned the pre-trained visual language models to achieve performance gain, yet suffering from overfitting and weak generalization. To deal with this, we introduce UniFGVC, a universal training-free framework that reformulates few-shot FGVC as multimodal retrieval. First, we propose the Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to exploit the open-world knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate a structured text description that captures the fine-grained attribute features distinguishing closely related classes. CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought prompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and enhance discrimination of generated captions. Using it we can convert each image into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature representation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot samples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and text encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by retrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad compatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization and adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios. Extensive experiments on 12 FGVC benchmarks demonstrate its consistent superiority over prior few-shot CLIP-based methods and even several fully-supervised MLLMs-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

By learning from hundreds of millions of natural protein sequences, protein understanding and design capabilities emerge. Recent works have shown that scaling these models improves structure prediction, but does not seem to improve mutation understanding and representation quality for protein function prediction. We introduce PoET-2, a multimodal, retrieval-augmented protein foundation model that incorporates in-context learning of family-specific evolutionary constraints with optional structure conditioning to learn generative distributions over protein sequences. PoET-2 uses a hierarchical transformer encoder that is equivariant to sequence context ordering and a dual decoder architecture with both causal and masked language modeling objectives, allowing PoET-2 to operate in both fully generative and bidirectional representation learning modes. PoET-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot variant effect prediction, excelling at scoring variants with multiple mutations and challenging indel mutations. In supervised settings, PoET-2 embeddings outperform previous methods for learning sequence-function relationships, especially with small datasets. This work highlights the benefits of combining retrieval augmentation with multimodal, family-centric modeling for advancing protein foundation models.</p></details> |  |

We introduce ArtSeek, a multimodal framework for art analysis that combines multimodal large language models with retrieval-augmented generation. Unlike prior work, our pipeline relies only on image input, enabling applicability to artworks without links to Wikidata or Wikipedia-common in most digitized collections. ArtSeek integrates three key components: an intelligent multimodal retrieval module based on late interaction retrieval, a contrastive multitask classification network for predicting artist, genre, style, media, and tags, and an agentic reasoning strategy enabled through in-context examples for complex visual question answering and artwork explanation via Qwen2.5-VL. Central to this approach is WikiFragments, a Wikipedia-scale dataset of image-text fragments curated to support knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including a +8.4% F1 improvement in style classification over GraphCLIP and a +7.1 BLEU@1 gain in captioning on ArtPedia. Qualitative analyses show that ArtSeek can interpret visual motifs, infer historical context, and retrieve relevant knowledge, even for obscure works. Though focused on visual arts, our approach generalizes to other domains requiring external knowledge, supporting scalable multimodal AI research. Both the dataset and the source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/cilabuniba/artseek.</p></details> |  |

Recent work leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to tackle this task. However, their large parameter size results in high training costs and low inference efficiency. To address this, we propose PUMA: a Layer-Pruned Language Model for Efficient Unified Multimodal Retrieval with Modality-Adaptive Learning. Our approach improves UMR from both structural and learning perspectives. (1) Structurally, we propose Layer-Pruned Self-Distillation, which prunes MLLMs by keeping only shallow layers while distilling features from dropped deep layers as teacher signals. This reduces parameters and preserves representation capability. (2) On the learning side, we introduce Modality-Adaptive Contrastive Learning Loss (MAC-Loss), which separates in-batch negatives into harder intra-modality and easier inter-modality groups based on the target modality, assigning different temperature strategies to enhance learning efficiency. Experiments show our method significantly reduces resource usage while maintaining strong performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

However, existing vision-language models, such as CLIP, face key challenges in e-commerce recommendation systems: 1) Weak object-level alignment, where global image embeddings fail to capture fine-grained product attributes, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance; 2) Ambiguous textual representations, where product descriptions often lack contextual clarity, affecting cross-modal matching; and 3) Domain mismatch, as generic vision-language models may not generalize well to e-commerce-specific data. To address these limitations, we propose a framework, VL-CLIP, that enhances CLIP embeddings by integrating Visual Grounding for fine-grained visual understanding and an LLM-based agent for generating enriched text embeddings. Visual Grounding refines image representations by localizing key products, while the LLM agent enhances textual features by disambiguating product descriptions. Our approach significantly improves retrieval accuracy, multimodal retrieval effectiveness, and recommendation quality across tens of millions of items on one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the U.S., increasing CTR by 18.6%, ATC by 15.5%, and GMV by 4.0%. Additional experimental results show that our framework outperforms vision-language models, including CLIP, FashionCLIP, and GCL, in both precision and semantic alignment, demonstrating the potential of combining object-aware visual grounding and LLM-enhanced text representation for robust multimodal recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at RecSys 2025; DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3705328.3748064</p></details> |

Despite their success, the mechanisms underlying their retrieval capabilities remain largely unexplored, potentially resulting in suboptimal performance and limited generalization ability. To address these issues, we present a comprehensive study aimed at uncovering the key factors that drive effective embedding learning for UMR using MLLMs. We begin by implementing a general MLLM-based embedding learning pipeline, and systematically analyze the primary contributors to high-performing universal retrieval systems. Based on this, we explore various aspects of the details in embedding generation and training strategies, including progressive transition, hard negative mining and re-ranker distillation. Notably, our findings reveal that often-overlooked factors can have a substantial impact on model performance. Building on these discoveries, we introduce a unified framework termed U-MARVEL (\textbf{U}niversal \textbf{M}ultimod\textbf{A}l \textbf{R}etrie\textbf{V}al via \textbf{E}mbedding \textbf{L}earning), which outperforms state-of-the-art competitors on the M-BEIR benchmark by a large margin in supervised settings, and also exihibits strong zero-shot performance on several tasks such as composed image retrieval and text-to-video retrieval. These results underscore the generalization potential of our framework across various embedding-based retrieval tasks.

This work presents the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs, including LLaVA-1.5 and LLaMA 3.2-Vision, on the textbook question answering (TQA) task using the CK12-QA dataset. We introduce a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to simulate real-world learning by providing relevant lesson paragraphs and diagrams as context. Our zero-shot experiments reveal a critical trade-off: while retrieved context improves LLaVA's performance on text-based questions, it significantly degrades the accuracy of the more powerful LLaMA 3.2-Vision on diagram-based tasks, dropping its validation accuracy from 74.07% to 25.93%. We term this statistically significant phenomenon "catastrophic context interference." Furthermore, fine-tuning highlights architectural differences: LLaMA 3.2-Vision's performance improves to 71.16% on the test set, demonstrating its capacity to learn multimodal integration, whereas LLaVA's performance declines, indicating challenges with generalization. Our results underscore the challenges MLLMs face in modality prioritization and context integration, providing a benchmark and pointing to key directions for developing more robust AI-driven educational tools.</p></details> | 8 Pages |

While dense text captions can achieve 75.9% Recall@5, they require expensive offline processing and miss critical visual information present in 34% of clips with scene text not captured by ASR. By analyzing query intent and predicting information needs, ModaRoute reduces computational overhead by 41% while achieving 60.9% Recall@5. Our approach uses GPT-4.1 to route queries across ASR (speech), OCR (text), and visual indices, averaging 1.78 modalities per query versus exhaustive 3.0 modality search. Evaluation on 1.8M video clips demonstrates that intelligent routing provides a practical solution for scaling multimodal retrieval systems, reducing infrastructure costs while maintaining competitive effectiveness for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025 Multimodal Representation and Retrieval Workshop</p></details> |

We release two model variants, 1B and 3B. The 3B model achieves state of the art performance, scoring NDCG@5 91.0 on ViDoRe V1 and 63.5 on ViDoRe V2, placing first on both leaderboards as of June 27, 2025. Our approach leverages the NVIDIA Eagle2 Vision-Language model (VLM), modifies its architecture by replacing causal attention with bidirectional attention, and integrates a ColBERT-style late interaction mechanism to enable fine-grained multimodal retrieval in a shared embedding space. While this mechanism delivers superior retrieval accuracy, it introduces trade-offs in storage and efficiency. We provide a comprehensive analysis of these trade-offs. Additionally, we adopt a two-stage training strategy to enhance the model's retrieval capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Although vision-language models (VLMs) are widely used for this task, they often generate factually incorrect answers. Retrieval-augmented generation addresses this challenge by providing information from external sources, but risks retrieving irrelevant context, which can degrade the reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Re-ranking retrievals, as introduced in existing approaches, enhances retrieval relevance by focusing on query-text alignment. However, these approaches neglect the visual or multimodal context, which is particularly crucial for medical diagnosis. We propose MOTOR, a novel multimodal retrieval and re-ranking approach that leverages grounded captions and optimal transport. It captures the underlying relationships between the query and the retrieved context based on textual and visual information. Consequently, our approach identifies more clinically relevant contexts to augment the VLM input. Empirical analysis and human expert evaluation demonstrate that MOTOR achieves higher accuracy on MedVQA datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.45%.

However, how to model the representation of trajectory-level data presents a significant challenge that has not been systematically addressed amid explosive trajectory data growth. In this work, we introduce Multimodal Trajectory Retrieval, bridging the gap between universal retrieval and agent-centric trajectory modeling. We construct the Unified Agent Trajectory Dataset (UATD) from annotated demonstrations and states across diverse real-world scenarios. Based on this, we present GAE-Bench, a benchmark containing a large number of trajectory-based retrieval pairs. In addition, we propose GAE-Retriever, a multimodal retrieval framework that adopts vision-language models and incorporates optimized contrastive learning through a token selection and the GradCache mechanism. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple datasets show that GAE-Retriever consistently outperforms strong baselines in retrieval recall, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing multimodal trajectory retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 3 figures, accepted by Workshop on Computer-use Agents @ ICML 2025</p></details> |

While recent advances in deep generative models and large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in structured content generation, most existing approaches lack grounding in contextual design exemplars and fall short in handling semantic alignment and visual coherence. In this work we introduce CAL-RAG, a retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for content-aware layout generation that integrates multimodal retrieval, large language models, and collaborative agentic reasoning. Our system retrieves relevant layout examples from a structured knowledge base and invokes an LLM-based layout recommender to propose structured element placements. A vision-language grader agent evaluates the layout with visual metrics, and a feedback agent provides targeted refinements, enabling iterative improvement. We implement our framework using LangGraph and evaluate it on the PKU PosterLayout dataset, a benchmark rich in semantic and structural variability. CAL-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple layout metrics -- including underlay effectiveness, element alignment, and overlap -- substantially outperforming strong baselines such as LayoutPrompter. These results demonstrate that combining retrieval augmentation with agentic multi-step reasoning yields a scalable, interpretable, and high-fidelity solution for automated layout generation.</p></details> |  |

The ROOMELSA challenge limits access to full 3D scene context, complicating reasoning about object appearance, geometry, and semantics. These challenges are intensified by distorted viewpoints, textureless masked regions, ambiguous language prompts, and noisy segmentation masks. To address this, we propose SAMURAI: Shape-Aware Multimodal Retrieval for 3D Object Identification. SAMURAI integrates CLIP-based semantic matching with shape-guided re-ranking derived from binary silhouettes of masked regions, alongside a robust majority voting strategy. A dedicated preprocessing pipeline enhances mask quality by extracting the largest connected component and removing background noise. Our hybrid retrieval framework leverages both language and shape cues, achieving competitive performance on the ROOMELSA private test set. These results highlight the importance of combining shape priors with language understanding for robust open-world 3D object retrieval.</p></details> |  |

Answering questions over such content often requires joint reasoning across modalities, which strains traditional large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented cross-modal context. We introduce MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework purpose-built for financial QA. MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal extraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to a lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both structured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries. These outputs, along with narrative text, are embedded and indexed with modality-aware similarity thresholds for precise retrieval. A tiered fallback strategy then dynamically escalates from text-only to text+table+image contexts when necessary, enabling cross-modal reasoning while reducing irrelevant context. Despite running on commodity hardware, MultiFinRAG achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy than ChatGPT-4o (free-tier) on complex financial QA tasks involving text, tables, images, and combined multimodal reasoning.</p></details> | Preprint Copy |

In this paper, we study the multimodal retrieval problem, where the visual information (e.g, image) of item is leveraged as supplementary of textual information to enrich item representation and further improve retrieval performance. Though learning from cross-modality data has been studied extensively in tasks such as visual question answering or media summarization, multimodal retrieval remains a non-trivial and unsolved problem especially in the asymmetric scenario where the query is unimodal while the item is multimodal. In this paper, we propose a novel model named SMAR, which stands for Semantic-enhanced Modality-Asymmetric Retrieval, to tackle the problem of modality fusion and alignment in this kind of asymmetric scenario. Extensive experimental results on an industrial dataset show that the proposed model outperforms baseline models significantly in retrieval accuracy.

While pooling reduces the annotation effort, it results in only partially labeled datasets. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative to reducing reliance on manual judgments, particularly in complex domains like medical case-based retrieval, where relevance assessment requires analyzing both textual and visual information. In this work, we explore using a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to expand relevance judgments, creating a new dataset of automated judgments. Specifically, we employ Gemini 1.5 Pro on the ImageCLEFmed 2013 case-based retrieval task, simulating human assessment through an iteratively refined, structured prompting strategy that integrates binary scoring, instruction-based evaluation, and few-shot learning. We systematically experimented with various prompt configurations to maximize agreement with human judgments. To evaluate agreement between the MLLM and human judgments, we use Cohen's Kappa, achieving a substantial agreement score of 0.6, comparable to inter-annotator agreement typically observed in multimodal retrieval tasks. Starting from the original 15,028 manual judgments (4.72% relevant) across 35 topics, our MLLM-based approach expanded the dataset by over 37x to 558,653 judgments, increasing relevant annotations to 5,950. On average, each medical case query received 15,398 new annotations, with approximately 99% being non-relevant, reflecting the high sparsity typical in this domain. Our results demonstrate the potential of MLLMs to scale relevance judgment collection, offering a promising direction for supporting retrieval evaluation in medical and multimodal IR tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the Third Workshop on Large Language Models for Evaluation in Information Retrieval (LLM4Eval 2025), co-located with SIGIR 2025. 9 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, their ability to represent multimodal information in the acoustic domain remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Vela, a novel framework designed to adapt MLLMs for the generation of universal multimodal embeddings. By leveraging MLLMs with specially crafted prompts and selected in-context learning examples, Vela effectively bridges the modality gap across various modalities. We then propose a single-modality training approach, where the model is trained exclusively on text pairs. Our experiments show that Vela outperforms traditional CLAP models in standard text-audio retrieval tasks. Furthermore, we introduce new benchmarks that expose CLAP models' limitations in handling long texts and complex retrieval tasks. In contrast, Vela, by harnessing the capabilities of MLLMs, demonstrates robust performance in these scenarios.

Moreover, while finetuned models are state-of-the-art on closed-domain tasks, general-purpose models like GPT-4o exhibit strong zero-shot performance. This raises questions about the trade-offs between memorization, generalization, and retrieval. In this work, we analyze the extent to which multimodal retrieval-augmented VLMs memorize training data compared to baseline VLMs. Using the WebQA benchmark, we contrast finetuned models with baseline VLMs on multihop retrieval and question answering, examining the impact of finetuning on data memorization. To quantify memorization in end-to-end retrieval and QA systems, we propose several proxy metrics by investigating instances where QA succeeds despite retrieval failing. In line with existing work, we find that finetuned models rely more heavily on memorization than retrieval-augmented VLMs, and achieve higher accuracy as a result (72% vs 52% on WebQA test set). Finally, we present the first empirical comparison of the parametric effect between text and visual modalities. Here, we find that image-based questions have parametric response rates that are consistently 15-25% higher than for text-based questions in the WebQA dataset. As such, our measures pose a challenge for future work, both to account for differences in model memorization across different modalities and more generally to reconcile memorization and generalization in joint Retrieval-QA tasks.</p></details> |  |

As robots and intelligent agents become more integrated into human life, there is a growing opportunity-and need-to offload the cognitive burden on humans to these systems, particularly in dynamic, information-rich scenarios. To fill this critical need, we present Multi-RAG, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation system designed to provide adaptive assistance to humans in information-intensive circumstances. Our system aims to improve situational understanding and reduce cognitive load by integrating and reasoning over multi-source information streams, including video, audio, and text. As an enabling step toward long-term human-robot partnerships, Multi-RAG explores how multimodal information understanding can serve as a foundation for adaptive robotic assistance in dynamic, human-centered situations. To evaluate its capability in a realistic human-assistance proxy task, we benchmarked Multi-RAG on the MMBench-Video dataset, a challenging multimodal video understanding benchmark. Our system achieves superior performance compared to existing open-source video large language models (Video-LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs), while utilizing fewer resources and less input data. The results demonstrate Multi- RAG's potential as a practical and efficient foundation for future human-robot adaptive assistance systems in dynamic, real-world contexts.</p></details> |  |

Although computerised maintenance systems effectively detect and classify faults, tasks like fault severity estimation, and maintenance decisions still largely depend on human expert analysis. The analysis and decision making automatically performed by current systems typically exhibit considerable uncertainty and high false alarm rates, leading to increased workload and reduced efficiency. This work integrates large language model (LLM)-based reasoning agents with CM workflows to address analyst and industry needs, namely reducing false alarms, enhancing fault severity estimation, improving decision support, and offering explainable interfaces. We propose MindRAG, a modular framework combining multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with novel vector store structures designed specifically for CM data. The framework leverages existing annotations and maintenance work orders as surrogates for labels in a supervised learning protocol, addressing the common challenge of training predictive models on unlabelled and noisy real-world datasets. The primary contributions include: (1) an approach for structuring industry CM data into a semi-structured multimodal vector store compatible with LLM-driven workflows; (2) developing multimodal RAG techniques tailored for CM data; (3) developing practical reasoning agents capable of addressing real-world CM queries; and (4) presenting an experimental framework for integrating and evaluating such agents in realistic industrial scenarios. Preliminary results, evaluated with the help of an experienced analyst, indicate that MindRAG provide meaningful decision support for more efficient management of alarms, thereby improving the interpretability of CM systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRACE: Grounding Time Series in Context for Multimodal Embedding and Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09114v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ubiquity of dynamic data in domains such as weather, healthcare, and energy underscores a growing need for effective interpretation and retrieval of time-series data. These data are inherently tied to domain-specific contexts, such as clinical notes or weather narratives, making cross-modal retrieval essential not only for downstream tasks but also for developing robust time-series foundation models by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite the increasing demand, time-series retrieval remains largely underexplored. Existing methods often lack semantic grounding, struggle to align heterogeneous modalities, and have limited capacity for handling multi-channel signals. To address this gap, we propose TRACE, a generic multimodal retriever that grounds time-series embeddings in aligned textual context. TRACE enables fine-grained channel-level alignment and employs hard negative mining to facilitate semantically meaningful retrieval. It supports flexible cross-modal retrieval modes, including Text-to-Timeseries and Timeseries-to-Text, effectively linking linguistic descriptions with complex temporal patterns. By retrieving semantically relevant pairs, TRACE enriches downstream models with informative context, leading to improved predictive accuracy and interpretability. Beyond a static retrieval engine, TRACE also serves as a powerful standalone encoder, with lightweight task-specific tuning that refines context-aware representations while maintaining strong cross-modal alignment. These representations achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream forecasting and classification tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple domains highlight its dual utility, as both an effective encoder for downstream applications and a general-purpose retriever to enhance time-series models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Representation Alignment for Cross-modal Information Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08774v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Different machine learning models can represent the same underlying concept in different ways. This variability is particularly valuable for in-the-wild multimodal retrieval, where the objective is to identify the corresponding representation in one modality given another modality as input. This challenge can be effectively framed as a feature alignment problem. For example, given a sentence encoded by a language model, retrieve the most semantically aligned image based on features produced by an image encoder, or vice versa. In this work, we first investigate the geometric relationships between visual and textual embeddings derived from both vision-language models and combined unimodal models. We then align these representations using four standard similarity metrics as well as two learned ones, implemented via neural networks. Our findings indicate that the Wasserstein distance can serve as an informative measure of the modality gap, while cosine similarity consistently outperforms alternative metrics in feature alignment tasks. Furthermore, we observe that conventional architectures such as multilayer perceptrons are insufficient for capturing the complex interactions between image and text representations. Our study offers novel insights and practical considerations for researchers working in multimodal information retrieval, particularly in real-world, cross-modal applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) are not designed for context-augmented generation, limiting their effectiveness in such tasks. While synthetic data generation has recently gained attention for training MLLMs, its application for context-augmented generation remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce SK-VQA, a large-scale synthetic multimodal dataset containing over 2 million visual question-answer pairs, each associated with context documents containing information necessary to determine the final answer. Compared to previous datasets, SK-VQA contains 11x more unique questions, exhibits greater domain diversity, and covers a broader spectrum of image sources. Through human evaluations, we confirm the high quality of the generated question-answer pairs and their contextual relevance. Extensive experiments show that SK-VQA serves both as a challenging KB-VQA benchmark and as an effective training resource for adapting MLLMs to context-augmented generation. Our results further indicate that models trained on SK-VQA demonstrate enhanced generalization in both context-aware VQA and multimodal RAG settings. SK-VQA is publicly available via Hugging Face Hub.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Spotlight Oral</p></details> |

However, existing methods still face challenges, such as the scarcity of knowledge with reasoning examples and erratic responses from retrieved knowledge. To address these issues, in this study, we propose a multimodal RAG framework, termed RCTS, which enhances LVLMs by constructing a Reasoning Context-enriched knowledge base and a Tree Search re-ranking method. Specifically, we introduce a self-consistent evaluation mechanism to enrich the knowledge base with intrinsic reasoning patterns. We further propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search with Heuristic Rewards (MCTS-HR) to prioritize the most relevant examples. This ensures that LVLMs can leverage high-quality contextual reasoning for better and more consistent responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple VQA datasets, significantly outperforming In-Context Learning (ICL) and Vanilla-RAG methods. It highlights the effectiveness of our knowledge base and re-ranking method in improving LVLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/yannqi/RCTS-RAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Spotlight. 22 pages, 16 figures</p></details> |

These knowledge databases may contain sensitive information that requires privacy protection. However, multimodal RAG systems inherently grant external users indirect access to such data, making them potentially vulnerable to privacy attacks, particularly membership inference attacks (MIAs). % Existing MIA methods targeting RAG systems predominantly focus on the textual modality, while the visual modality remains relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose MrM, the first black-box MIA framework targeted at multimodal RAG systems. It utilizes a multi-object data perturbation framework constrained by counterfactual attacks, which can concurrently induce the RAG systems to retrieve the target data and generate information that leaks the membership information. Our method first employs an object-aware data perturbation method to constrain the perturbation to key semantics and ensure successful retrieval. Building on this, we design a counterfact-informed mask selection strategy to prioritize the most informative masked regions, aiming to eliminate the interference of model self-knowledge and amplify attack efficacy. Finally, we perform statistical membership inference by modeling query trials to extract features that reflect the reconstruction of masked semantics from response patterns. Experiments on two visual datasets and eight mainstream commercial visual-language models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2) demonstrate that MrM achieves consistently strong performance across both sample-level and set-level evaluations, and remains robust under adaptive defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLaMR: Contextualized Late-Interaction for Multimodal Content Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06144v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online video web content is richly multimodal: a single video blends vision, speech, ambient audio, and on-screen text. Retrieval systems typically treat these modalities as independent retrieval sources, which can lead to noisy and subpar retrieval. We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where relevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple modalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must dynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the query. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that jointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text, and metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal backbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic modality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training data for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale synthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in various languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we propose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard contrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality usage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation strategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade performance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities. In contrast, CLaMR consistently outperforms existing retrievers: on MultiVENT 2.0++, CLaMR improves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over the best single-modality retriever and by 35.4 over the best multi-modality retriever. We illustrate CLaMR's downstream utility on long-video QA, retrieving relevant frames and obtaining a 3.50% boost over LanguageBind on Video-MME and 1.42% over dense sampling on LongVideoBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages.

Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which process both visual and textual data, offer an opportunity to unify perception and reasoning. However, effectively embedding precise safety knowledge into MLLMs for autonomous driving remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose SafeAuto, a framework that enhances MLLM-based autonomous driving by incorporating both unstructured and structured knowledge. First, we introduce a Position-Dependent Cross-Entropy (PDCE) loss to improve low-level control signal predictions when values are represented as text. Second, to explicitly integrate safety knowledge, we develop a reasoning component that translates traffic rules into first-order logic (e.g., "red light $\implies$ stop") and embeds them into a probabilistic graphical model (e.g., Markov Logic Network) to verify predicted actions using recognized environmental attributes. Additionally, our Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model leverages video, control signals, and environmental attributes to learn from past driving experiences. Integrating PDCE, MLN, and Multimodal RAG, SafeAuto outperforms existing baselines across multiple datasets, enabling more accurate, reliable, and safer autonomous driving.

To address these challenges, we propose Cross-source knowledge \textbf{Re}conciliation for Multimodal RAG (CoRe-MMRAG), a novel end-to-end framework that effectively reconciles inconsistencies across knowledge sources. CoRe-MMRAG follows a four-stage pipeline: it first generates an internal response from parametric knowledge, then selects the most relevant multimodal evidence via joint similarity assessment, generates an external response, and finally integrates both to produce a reliable answer. Additionally, a specialized training paradigm enhances knowledge source discrimination, multimodal integration, and unified answer generation. Experiments on KB-VQA benchmarks show that CoRe-MMRAG achieves substantial improvements over baseline methods, achieving 5.6% and 9.3% performance gains on InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Main</p></details> |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by integrating external dynamic information for improved factual grounding. With advances in multimodal learning, Multimodal RAG extends this approach by incorporating multiple modalities such as text, images, audio, and video to enhance the generated outputs. However, cross-modal alignment and reasoning introduce unique challenges beyond those in unimodal RAG. This survey offers a structured and comprehensive analysis of Multimodal RAG systems, covering datasets, benchmarks, metrics, evaluation, methodologies, and innovations in retrieval, fusion, augmentation, and generation.

| **[Who is in the Spotlight: The Hidden Bias Undermining Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11063v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become essential in knowledge-intensive and open-domain tasks. As retrieval complexity increases, ensuring the robustness of these systems is critical. However, current RAG models are highly sensitive to the order in which evidence is presented, often resulting in unstable performance and biased reasoning, particularly as the number of retrieved items or modality diversity grows. This raises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect multimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive study of position bias in multimodal RAG systems. Through controlled experiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy curve with respect to evidence position. To quantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and develop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across decoder layers. Our results reveal that multimodal interactions intensify position bias compared to unimodal settings, and that this bias increases logarithmically with retrieval range. These findings offer both theoretical and empirical foundations for position-aware analysis in RAG, highlighting the need for evidence reordering or debiasing strategies to build more reliable and equitable generation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[DocReRank: Single-Page Hard Negative Query Generation for Training Multi-Modal RAG Rerankers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22584v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rerankers play a critical role in multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by refining ranking of an initial set of retrieved documents. Rerankers are typically trained using hard negative mining, whose goal is to select pages for each query which rank high, but are actually irrelevant. However, this selection process is typically passive and restricted to what the retriever can find in the available corpus, leading to several inherent limitations. These include: limited diversity, negative examples which are often not hard enough, low controllability, and frequent false negatives which harm training. Our paper proposes an alternative approach: Single-Page Hard Negative Query Generation, which goes the other way around. Instead of retrieving negative pages per query, we generate hard negative queries per page. Using an automated LLM-VLM pipeline, and given a page and its positive query, we create hard negatives by rephrasing the query to be as similar as possible in form and context, yet not answerable from the page. This paradigm enables fine-grained control over the generated queries, resulting in diverse, hard, and targeted negatives. It also supports efficient false negative verification. Our experiments show that rerankers trained with data generated using our approach outperform existing models and significantly improve retrieval performance.</p></details> |  |

Existing MRAG methods typically adopt a static retrieval pipeline that fetches relevant information from multiple Knowledge Bases (KBs), followed by a refinement step. However, these approaches overlook the reasoning and planning capabilities of MLLMs to dynamically determine how to interact with different KBs during the reasoning process. To address this limitation, we propose R1-Router, a novel MRAG framework that learns to decide when and where to retrieve knowledge based on the evolving reasoning state. Specifically, R1-Router can generate follow-up queries according to the current reasoning step, routing these intermediate queries to the most suitable KB, and integrating external knowledge into a coherent reasoning trajectory to answer the original query. Furthermore, we introduce Step-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), a tailored reinforcement learning algorithm that assigns step-specific rewards to optimize the reasoning behavior of MLLMs. Experimental results on various open-domain QA benchmarks across multiple modalities demonstrate that R1-Router outperforms baseline models by over 7%. Further analysis shows that R1-Router can adaptively and effectively leverage diverse KBs, reducing unnecessary retrievals and improving both efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Our work provides the first comprehensive analysis of how modality-specific data properties influence downstream task performance across diverse scenarios. Moreover, we propose Modal-Aware Masked Contrastive Learning (MAMCL) to mitigate the competitive relationships among the instances of different modalities.

Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that strategic modality curation and tailored training protocols are pivotal for robust cross-modal representation learning.

| **[Benchmarking Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation with Dynamic VQA Dataset and Self-adaptive Planning Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02937v5)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (mRAG) plays an important role in mitigating the "hallucination" issue inherent in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Although promising, existing heuristic mRAGs typically predefined fixed retrieval processes, which causes two issues: (1) Non-adaptive Retrieval Queries. (2) Overloaded Retrieval Queries. However, these flaws cannot be adequately reflected by current knowledge-seeking visual question answering (VQA) datasets, since the most required knowledge can be readily obtained with a standard two-step retrieval. To bridge the dataset gap, we first construct Dyn-VQA dataset, consisting of three types of "dynamic" questions, which require complex knowledge retrieval strategies variable in query, tool, and time: (1) Questions with rapidly changing answers. (2) Questions requiring multi-modal knowledge. (3) Multi-hop questions. Experiments on Dyn-VQA reveal that existing heuristic mRAGs struggle to provide sufficient and precisely relevant knowledge for dynamic questions due to their rigid retrieval processes. Hence, we further propose the first self-adaptive planning agent for multimodal retrieval, OmniSearch. The underlying idea is to emulate the human behavior in question solution which dynamically decomposes complex multimodal questions into sub-question chains with retrieval action. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of our OmniSearch, also provide direction for advancing mRAG.

While existing extractive video summarization methods struggle to produce a coherent narrative, existing abstractive methods cannot `quote' from the input videos, i.e., inserting short video clips in their outputs. In this work, we explore novel video editing models for generating shorts that feature a coherent narrative with embedded video insertions extracted from a long input video. We propose a novel retrieval-embedded generation framework that allows a large language model to quote multimodal resources while maintaining a coherent narrative. Our proposed REGen system first generates the output story script with quote placeholders using a finetuned large language model, and then uses a novel retrieval model to replace the quote placeholders by selecting a video clip that best supports the narrative from a pool of candidate quotable video clips. We examine the proposed method on the task of documentary teaser generation, where short interview insertions are commonly used to support the narrative of a documentary. Our objective evaluations show that the proposed method can effectively insert short video clips while maintaining a coherent narrative. In a subjective survey, we show that our proposed method outperforms existing abstractive and extractive approaches in terms of coherence, alignment, and realism in teaser generation.</p></details> |  |

However, current retrieval methods primarily focus on surface-level similarities of textual or visual cues in trajectories, neglecting their effectiveness for the specific task at hand. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, MLLM As ReTriever (MART), which enhances the performance of embodied agents by utilizing interaction data to fine-tune an MLLM retriever based on preference learning, such that the retriever fully considers the effectiveness of trajectories and prioritizes them for unseen tasks. We also introduce Trajectory Abstraction, a mechanism that leverages MLLMs' summarization capabilities to represent trajectories with fewer tokens while preserving key information, enabling agents to better comprehend milestones in the trajectory. Experimental results across various environments demonstrate our method significantly improves task success rates in unseen scenes compared to baseline methods. This work presents a new paradigm for multimodal retrieval in embodied agents, by fine-tuning a general-purpose MLLM as the retriever to assess trajectory effectiveness.

They often directly fuse the two modalities for cross-reference during the alignment to understand multimodal queries. However, existing methods often overlook crucial visual information due to a text-dominant issue, which overly depends on text-driven signals. In this paper, we introduce MIRe, a retrieval framework that achieves modality interaction without fusing textual features during the alignment. Our method allows the textual query to attend to visual embeddings while not feeding text-driven signals back into the visual representations. Additionally, we construct a pre-training dataset for multimodal query retrieval by transforming concise question-answer pairs into extended passages. Our experiments demonstrate that our pre-training strategy significantly enhances the understanding of multimodal queries, resulting in strong performance across four multimodal retrieval benchmarks under zero-shot settings.

Yet, these models frequently fall short in interpreting cultural nuances effectively. Prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in enhancing cultural understanding in text-only settings, while its application in multimodal scenarios remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAVENEA (Retrieval-Augmented Visual culturE uNdErstAnding), a new benchmark designed to advance visual culture understanding through retrieval, focusing on two tasks: culture-focused visual question answering (cVQA) and culture-informed image captioning (cIC). RAVENEA extends existing datasets by integrating over 10,000 Wikipedia documents curated and ranked by human annotators. With RAVENEA, we train and evaluate seven multimodal retrievers for each image query, and measure the downstream impact of retrieval-augmented inputs across fourteen state-of-the-art VLMs. Our results show that lightweight VLMs, when augmented with culture-aware retrieval, outperform their non-augmented counterparts (by at least 3.2% absolute on cVQA and 6.2% absolute on cIC). This highlights the value of retrieval-augmented methods and culturally inclusive benchmarks for multimodal understanding.</p></details> |  |

This study presents a novel multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation-based framework that automates anomaly detection across various Additive Manufacturing processes leveraging retrieved information from literature, including images and descriptive text, rather than training datasets. This framework integrates text and image retrieval from scientific literature and multimodal generation models to perform zero-shot anomaly identification, classification, and explanation generation in a Laser Powder Bed Fusion setting. The proposed framework is evaluated on four L-PBF manufacturing datasets from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, featuring various printer makes, models, and materials. This evaluation demonstrates the framework's adaptability and generalizability across diverse images without requiring additional training. Comparative analysis using Qwen2-VL-2B and GPT-4o-mini as MLLM within the proposed framework highlights that GPT-4o-mini outperforms Qwen2-VL-2B and proportional random baseline in manufacturing anomalies classification. Additionally, the evaluation of the RAG system confirms that incorporating retrieval mechanisms improves average accuracy by 12% by reducing the risk of hallucination and providing additional information. The proposed framework can be continuously updated by integrating emerging research, allowing seamless adaptation to the evolving landscape of AM technologies.

Its effectiveness primarily stems from the use of natural language as rich supervision. Motivated by the remarkable advancements in large language models (LLMs), this work explores how LLMs' superior text understanding and extensive open-world knowledge can enhance CLIP's capability, especially for processing longer and more complex image captions. We propose an efficient post-training strategy that integrates LLMs into pretrained CLIP. To address the challenge posed by the autoregressive nature of LLMs, we introduce a caption-to-caption contrastive fine-tuning framework, significantly enhancing the discriminative quality of LLM outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms LoRA-based methods, achieving nearly fourfold faster training with superior performance. Furthermore, we validate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art models such as CLIP, EVA02, and SigLip2 across various zero-shot multimodal retrieval tasks, cross-lingual retrieval tasks, and multimodal language model pretraining.</p></details> |  |

However, it has been shown that these models are subject to a modality gap phenomenon meaning there exists a clear separation between the embeddings from one modality and another in the embedding space. While this misalignment is detrimental for downstream tasks such as multimodal retrieval, multimodal clustering or zero-shot classification, etc. no generic and practical methods have so far been proposed to assess it precisely and even reduce it. We therefore propose novel measures and effective techniques (spectral- and optimal transport-based methods) to achieve this goal. Extensive experiments conducted on several image-text datasets and models demonstrate their effectiveness and beneficial effects on downstream tasks.

To bridge this gap, we propose a unified multi-granularity multimodal retrieval framework tailored for two benchmark tasks: MMDocIR and M2KR. Our approach integrates hierarchical encoding strategies, modality-aware retrieval mechanisms, and vision-language model (VLM)-based candidate filtering to effectively capture and utilize the complex interdependencies between textual and visual modalities. By leveraging off-the-shelf vision-language models and implementing a training-free hybrid retrieval strategy, our framework demonstrates robust performance without the need for task-specific fine-tuning. Experimental evaluations reveal that incorporating layout-aware search and VLM-based candidate verification significantly enhances retrieval accuracy, achieving a top performance score of 65.56.

| **[T2VShield: Model-Agnostic Jailbreak Defense for Text-to-Video Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15512v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence has made text to video models essential for building future multimodal world simulators. However, these models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where specially crafted prompts bypass safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful or unsafe content. Such vulnerabilities undermine the reliability and security of simulation based applications. In this paper, we propose T2VShield, a comprehensive and model agnostic defense framework designed to protect text to video models from jailbreak threats. Our method systematically analyzes the input, model, and output stages to identify the limitations of existing defenses, including semantic ambiguities in prompts, difficulties in detecting malicious content in dynamic video outputs, and inflexible model centric mitigation strategies. T2VShield introduces a prompt rewriting mechanism based on reasoning and multimodal retrieval to sanitize malicious inputs, along with a multi scope detection module that captures local and global inconsistencies across time and modalities. The framework does not require access to internal model parameters and works with both open and closed source systems. Extensive experiments on five platforms show that T2VShield can reduce jailbreak success rates by up to 35 percent compared to strong baselines. We further develop a human centered audiovisual evaluation protocol to assess perceptual safety, emphasizing the importance of visual level defense in enhancing the trustworthiness of next generation multimodal simulators.</p></details> | 33 pages, 9 figures |
| **[MRAMG-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Advancing Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04176v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have significantly improved response accuracy and relevance by incorporating external knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RAG methods primarily focus on generating text-only answers, even in Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) scenarios, where multimodal elements are retrieved to assist in generating text answers. To address this, we introduce the Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Generation (MRAMG) task, in which we aim to generate multimodal answers that combine both text and images, fully leveraging the multimodal data within a corpus. Despite growing attention to this challenging task, a notable lack of a comprehensive benchmark persists for effectively evaluating its performance. To bridge this gap, we provide MRAMG-Bench, a meticulously curated, human-annotated benchmark comprising 4,346 documents, 14,190 images, and 4,800 QA pairs, distributed across six distinct datasets and spanning three domains: Web, Academia, and Lifestyle. The datasets incorporate diverse difficulty levels and complex multi-image scenarios, providing a robust foundation for evaluating the MRAMG task. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, MRAMG-Bench incorporates a comprehensive suite of both statistical and LLM-based metrics, enabling a thorough analysis of the performance of generative models in the MRAMG task. Additionally, we propose an efficient and flexible multimodal answer generation framework that can leverage LLMs/MLLMs to generate multimodal responses. Our datasets and complete evaluation results for 11 popular generative models are available at https://github.com/MRAMG-Bench/MRAMG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at SIGIR 2025; 11 pages</p></details> |
| **[HM-RAG: Hierarchical Multi-Agent Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12330v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) augments Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge, conventional single-agent RAG remains fundamentally limited in resolving complex queries demanding coordinated reasoning across heterogeneous data ecosystems. We present HM-RAG, a novel Hierarchical Multi-agent Multimodal RAG framework that pioneers collaborative intelligence for dynamic knowledge synthesis across structured, unstructured, and graph-based data. The framework is composed of three-tiered architecture with specialized agents: a Decomposition Agent that dissects complex queries into contextually coherent sub-tasks via semantic-aware query rewriting and schema-guided context augmentation; Multi-source Retrieval Agents that carry out parallel, modality-specific retrieval using plug-and-play modules designed for vector, graph, and web-based databases; and a Decision Agent that uses consistency voting to integrate multi-source answers and resolve discrepancies in retrieval results through Expert Model Refinement. This architecture attains comprehensive query understanding by combining textual, graph-relational, and web-derived evidence, resulting in a remarkable 12.95% improvement in answer accuracy and a 3.56% boost in question classification accuracy over baseline RAG systems on the ScienceQA and CrisisMMD benchmarks. Notably, HM-RAG establishes state-of-the-art results in zero-shot settings on both datasets. Its modular architecture ensures seamless integration of new data modalities while maintaining strict data governance, marking a significant advancement in addressing the critical challenges of multimodal reasoning and knowledge synthesis in RAG systems.

| **[Leveraging LLMs for Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Radiology Report Generation via Key Phrase Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07415v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated radiology report generation (RRG) holds potential to reduce radiologists' workload, especially as recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) enable the development of multimodal models for chest X-ray (CXR) report generation. However, multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) are resource-intensive, requiring vast datasets and substantial computational cost for training. To address these challenges, we propose a retrieval-augmented generation approach that leverages multimodal retrieval and LLMs to generate radiology reports while mitigating hallucinations and reducing computational demands. Our method uses LLMs to extract key phrases from radiology reports, effectively focusing on essential diagnostic information. Through exploring effective training strategies, including image encoder structure search, adding noise to text embeddings, and additional training objectives, we combine complementary pre-trained image encoders and adopt contrastive learning between text and semantic image embeddings. We evaluate our approach on MIMIC-CXR dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results on CheXbert metrics and competitive RadGraph F1 metric alongside MLLMs, without requiring LLM fine-tuning. Our method demonstrates robust generalization for multi-view RRG, making it suitable for comprehensive clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[IDMR: Towards Instance-Driven Precise Visual Correspondence in Multimodal Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00954v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval systems are becoming increasingly vital for cutting-edge AI technologies, such as embodied AI and AI-driven digital content industries. However, current multimodal retrieval tasks lack sufficient complexity and demonstrate limited practical application value. It spires us to design Instance-Driven Multimodal Image Retrieval (IDMR), a novel task that requires models to retrieve images containing the same instance as a query image while matching a text-described scenario. Unlike existing retrieval tasks focused on global image similarity or category-level matching, IDMR demands fine-grained instance-level consistency across diverse contexts. To benchmark this capability, we develop IDMR-bench using real-world object tracking and first-person video data. Addressing the scarcity of training data, we propose a cross-domain synthesis method that creates 557K training samples by cropping objects from standard detection datasets. Our Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based retrieval model, trained on 1.2M samples, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both traditional benchmarks and our zero-shot IDMR-bench. Experimental results demonstrate previous models' limitations in instance-aware retrieval and highlight the potential of MLLM for advanced retrieval applications. The whole training dataset, codes and models, with wide ranges of sizes, are available at https://github.com/BwLiu01/IDMR.</p></details> |  |
| **[GME: Improving Universal Multimodal Retrieval by Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16855v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Universal Multimodal Retrieval (UMR) aims to enable search across various modalities using a unified model, where queries and candidates can consist of pure text, images, or a combination of both. Previous work has attempted to adopt multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to realize UMR using only text data. However, our preliminary experiments demonstrate that more diverse multimodal training data can further unlock the potential of MLLMs. Despite its effectiveness, the existing multimodal training data is highly imbalanced in terms of modality, which motivates us to develop a training data synthesis pipeline and construct a large-scale, high-quality fused-modal training dataset. Based on the synthetic training data, we develop the General Multimodal Embedder (GME), an MLLM-based dense retriever designed for UMR. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive UMR Benchmark (UMRB) to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing UMR methods. Last, we provide in-depth analyses of model scaling and training strategies, and perform ablation studies on both the model and synthetic data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025, models at https://huggingface.co/Alibaba-NLP/gme-Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct</p></details> |
| **[RAP: Retrieval-Augmented Personalization for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13360v3)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as general assistants. However, lack of user-specific knowledge still restricts their application in human's daily life. In this paper, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Personalization (RAP) framework for MLLMs' personalization. Starting from a general MLLM, we turn it into a personalized assistant in three steps. (a) Remember: We design a key-value database to store user-related information, e.g., user's name, avatar and other attributes. (b) Retrieve: When the user initiates a conversation, RAP will retrieve relevant information from the database using a multimodal retriever. (c) Generate: The input query and retrieved concepts' information are fed into MLLMs to generate personalized, knowledge-augmented responses. Unlike previous methods, RAP allows real-time concept editing via updating the external database. To further improve generation quality and alignment with user-specific information, we design a pipeline for data collection and create a specialized dataset for personalized training of MLLMs. Based on the dataset, we train a series of MLLMs as personalized multimodal assistants. By pretraining on large-scale dataset, RAP-MLLMs can generalize to infinite visual concepts without additional finetuning. Our models demonstrate outstanding flexibility and generation quality across a variety of tasks, such as personalized image captioning, question answering and visual recognition.

| **[A Survey of Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08748v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating multimodal data (text, images, videos) into retrieval and generation processes, overcoming the limitations of text-only Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). While RAG improves response accuracy by incorporating external textual knowledge, MRAG extends this framework to include multimodal retrieval and generation, leveraging contextual information from diverse data types. This approach reduces hallucinations and enhances question-answering systems by grounding responses in factual, multimodal knowledge. Recent studies show MRAG outperforms traditional RAG, especially in scenarios requiring both visual and textual understanding. This survey reviews MRAG's essential components, datasets, evaluation methods, and limitations, providing insights into its construction and improvement. It also identifies challenges and future research directions, highlighting MRAG's potential to revolutionize multimodal information retrieval and generation. By offering a comprehensive perspective, this work encourages further exploration into this promising paradigm.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAFe: Unifying Representation and Generation with Contrastive-Autoregressive Finetuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19900v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has driven significant progress in multimodal tasks, enabling models to interpret, reason, and generate outputs across both visual and textual domains. While excelling in generative tasks, existing LVLMs often face limitations in tasks requiring high-fidelity representation learning, such as generating image or text embeddings for retrieval. Recent work has proposed finetuning LVLMs for representational learning, but the fine-tuned model often loses its generative capabilities due to the representational learning training paradigm. To address this trade-off, we introduce CAFe, a contrastive-autoregressive fine-tuning framework that enhances LVLMs for both representation and generative tasks. By integrating a contrastive objective with autoregressive language modeling, our approach unifies these traditionally separate tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in both multimodal retrieval and multimodal generative benchmarks, including object hallucination (OH) mitigation. CAFe establishes a novel framework that synergizes embedding and generative functionalities in a single model, setting a foundation for future multimodal models that excel in both retrieval precision and coherent output generation.</p></details> |  |

However, current systems struggle in accurately interpreting user intent, employing diverse retrieval strategies, and effectively filtering unintended or inappropriate responses, limiting their effectiveness. This paper introduces Contextual Understanding and Enhanced Search with MLLM (CUE-M), a novel multimodal search framework that addresses these challenges through a multi-stage pipeline comprising image context enrichment, intent refinement, contextual query generation, external API integration, and relevance-based filtering. CUE-M incorporates a robust filtering pipeline combining image-based, text-based, and multimodal classifiers, dynamically adapting to instance- and category-specific concern defined by organizational policies. Extensive experiments on real-word datasets and public benchmarks on knowledge-based VQA and safety demonstrated that CUE-M outperforms baselines and establishes new state-of-the-art results, advancing the capabilities of multimodal retrieval systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, there are scenarios where retrieving visual information is either more beneficial or easier to access than textual data. In this paper, we introduce a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation benchmark, MRAG-Bench, in which we systematically identify and categorize scenarios where visually augmented knowledge is better than textual knowledge, for instance, more images from varying viewpoints. MRAG-Bench consists of 16,130 images and 1,353 human-annotated multiple-choice questions across 9 distinct scenarios. With MRAG-Bench, we conduct an evaluation of 10 open-source and 4 proprietary large vision-language models (LVLMs). Our results show that all LVLMs exhibit greater improvements when augmented with images compared to textual knowledge, confirming that MRAG-Bench is vision-centric. Additionally, we conduct extensive analysis with MRAG-Bench, which offers valuable insights into retrieval-augmented LVLMs. Notably, the top-performing model, GPT-4o, faces challenges in effectively leveraging retrieved knowledge, achieving only a 5.82% improvement with ground-truth information, in contrast to a 33.16% improvement observed in human participants. These findings highlight the importance of MRAG-Bench in encouraging the community to enhance LVLMs' ability to utilize retrieved visual knowledge more effectively.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

In this work, we introduce \textit{Poisoned-MRAG}, the first knowledge poisoning attack on multimodal RAG systems. Poisoned-MRAG injects a few carefully crafted image-text pairs into the multimodal knowledge database, manipulating VLMs to generate the attacker-desired response to a target query. Specifically, we formalize the attack as an optimization problem and propose two cross-modal attack strategies, dirty-label and clean-label, tailored to the attacker's knowledge and goals. Our extensive experiments across multiple knowledge databases and VLMs show that Poisoned-MRAG outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 98\% attack success rate with just five malicious image-text pairs injected into the InfoSeek database (481,782 pairs). Additionally, We evaluate 4 different defense strategies, including paraphrasing, duplicate removal, structure-driven mitigation, and purification, demonstrating their limited effectiveness and trade-offs against Poisoned-MRAG. Our results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of Poisoned-MRAG, underscoring its potential as a significant threat to multimodal RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anatomy-Aware Conditional Image-Text Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07456v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-Text Retrieval (ITR) finds broad applications in healthcare, aiding clinicians and radiologists by automatically retrieving relevant patient cases in the database given the query image and/or report, for more efficient clinical diagnosis and treatment, especially for rare diseases. However conventional ITR systems typically only rely on global image or text representations for measuring patient image/report similarities, which overlook local distinctiveness across patient cases. This often results in suboptimal retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose an Anatomical Location-Conditioned Image-Text Retrieval (ALC-ITR) framework, which, given a query image and the associated suspicious anatomical region(s), aims to retrieve similar patient cases exhibiting the same disease or symptoms in the same anatomical region. To perform location-conditioned multimodal retrieval, we learn a medical Relevance-Region-Aligned Vision Language (RRA-VL) model with semantic global-level and region-/word-level alignment to produce generalizable, well-aligned multi-modal representations. Additionally, we perform location-conditioned contrastive learning to further utilize cross-pair region-level contrastiveness for improved multi-modal retrieval. We show that our proposed RRA-VL achieves state-of-the-art localization performance in phase-grounding tasks, and satisfying multi-modal retrieval performance with or without location conditioning. Finally, we thoroughly investigate the generalizability and explainability of our proposed ALC-ITR system in providing explanations and preliminary diagnosis reports given retrieved patient cases (conditioned on anatomical regions), with proper off-the-shelf LLM prompts.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |
