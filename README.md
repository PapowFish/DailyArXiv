| **[Empowering Agentic Video Analytics Systems with Video Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00254v4)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-driven video analytics has become increasingly important across diverse domains. However, existing systems are often constrained to specific, predefined tasks, limiting their adaptability in open-ended analytical scenarios. The recent emergence of Vision Language Models (VLMs) as transformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling open-ended video understanding, reasoning, and analytics. Nevertheless, their limited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video content, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we introduce AVA, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video analytics. AVA incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time construction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or continuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism that leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that AVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy, respectively-significantly surpassing existing VLM and video Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video analytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new benchmark, AVA-100. This benchmark comprises 8 videos, each exceeding 10 hours in duration, along with 120 manually annotated, diverse, and complex question-answer pairs. On AVA-100, AVA achieves top-tier performance with an accuracy of 75.8%. The source code of AVA is available at https://github.com/I-ESC/Project-Ava. The AVA-100 benchmark can be accessed at https://huggingface.co/datasets/iesc/Ava-100.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NDSI 2026, 19pages, 12 figures, complementary evaluations and appendix</p></details> |
| **[Learning World Models for Interactive Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21996v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundational world models must be both interactive and preserve spatiotemporal coherence for effective future planning with action choices. However, present models for long video generation have limited inherent world modeling capabilities due to two main challenges: compounding errors and insufficient memory mechanisms. We enhance image-to-video models with interactive capabilities through additional action conditioning and autoregressive framework, and reveal that compounding error is inherently irreducible in autoregressive video generation, while insufficient memory mechanism leads to incoherence of world models. We propose video retrieval augmented generation (VRAG) with explicit global state conditioning, which significantly reduces long-term compounding errors and increases spatiotemporal consistency of world models. In contrast, naive autoregressive generation with extended context windows and retrieval-augmented generation prove less effective for video generation, primarily due to the limited in-context learning capabilities of current video models. Our work illuminates the fundamental challenges in video world models and establishes a comprehensive benchmark for improving video generation models with internal world modeling capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sites.google.com/view/vrag</p></details> |
| **[MUVR: A Multi-Modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval Benchmark with Multi-Level Visual Correspondence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21406v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos, tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance) and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3) Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base, Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and reranking. Our code and benchmark is available at https://github.com/debby-0527/MUVR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 D&B Track</p></details> |
| **[Panorama: Fast-Track Nearest Neighbors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00566v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space, aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99% of query time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms compact over 90% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts, SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns. Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rebalancing Contrastive Alignment with Bottlenecked Semantic Increments in Text-Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12499v5)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in text-video retrieval has been largely driven by contrastive learning. However, existing methods often overlook the effect of the modality gap, which causes anchor representations to undergo in-place optimization (i.e., optimization tension) that limits their alignment capacity. Moreover, noisy hard negatives further distort the semantics of anchors. To address these issues, we propose GARE, a Gap-Aware Retrieval framework that introduces a learnable, pair-specific increment $\Delta_{ij}$ between text $t_i$ and video $v_j$, redistributing gradients to relieve optimization tension and absorb noise. We derive $\Delta_{ij}$ via a multivariate first-order Taylor expansion of the InfoNCE loss under a trust-region constraint, showing that it guides updates along locally consistent descent directions. A lightweight neural module conditioned on the semantic gap couples increments across batches for structure-aware correction. Furthermore, we regularize $\Delta$ through a variational information bottleneck with relaxed compression, enhancing stability and semantic consistency. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that GARE consistently improves alignment accuracy and robustness, validating the effectiveness of gap-aware tension mitigation. Code is available at https://github.com/musicman217/GARE-text-video-retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Frame-Difference Guided Dynamic Region Perception for CLIP Adaptation in Text-Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21806v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of video data, text-video retrieval technology has become increasingly important in numerous application scenarios such as recommendation and search. Early text-video retrieval methods suffer from two critical drawbacks: first, they heavily rely on large-scale annotated video-text pairs, leading to high data acquisition costs; second, there is a significant modal gap between video and text features, which limits cross-modal alignment accuracy. With the development of vision-language model, adapting CLIP to video tasks has attracted great attention. However, existing adaptation methods generally lack enhancement for dynamic video features and fail to effectively suppress static redundant features. To address this issue, this paper proposes FDA-CLIP (Frame Difference Alpha-CLIP), which is a concise CLIP-based training framework for text-video alignment. Specifically, the method uses frame differences to generate dynamic region masks, which are input into Alpha-CLIP as an additional Alpha channel. This proactively guides the model to focus on semantically critical dynamic regions while suppressing static background redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that frame difference-guided video semantic encoding can effectively balance retrieval efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[VimoRAG: Video-based Retrieval-augmented 3D Motion Generation for Motion Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12081v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces VimoRAG, a novel video-based retrieval-augmented motion generation framework for motion large language models (LLMs). As motion LLMs face severe out-of-domain/out-of-vocabulary issues due to limited annotated data, VimoRAG leverages large-scale in-the-wild video databases to enhance 3D motion generation by retrieving relevant 2D human motion signals. While video-based motion RAG is nontrivial, we address two key bottlenecks: (1) developing an effective motion-centered video retrieval model that distinguishes human poses and actions, and (2) mitigating the issue of error propagation caused by suboptimal retrieval results. We design the Gemini Motion Video Retriever mechanism and the Motion-centric Dual-alignment DPO Trainer, enabling effective retrieval and generation processes. Experimental results show that VimoRAG significantly boosts the performance of motion LLMs constrained to text-only input.

| **[RefAtomNet++: Advancing Referring Atomic Video Action Recognition using Semantic Retrieval based Multi-Trajectory Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16444v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Atomic Video Action Recognition (RAVAR) aims to recognize fine-grained, atomic-level actions of a specific person of interest conditioned on natural language descriptions. Distinct from conventional action recognition and detection tasks, RAVAR emphasizes precise language-guided action understanding, which is particularly critical for interactive human action analysis in complex multi-person scenarios. In this work, we extend our previously introduced RefAVA dataset to RefAVA++, which comprises >2.9 million frames and >75.1k annotated persons in total. We benchmark this dataset using baselines from multiple related domains, including atomic action localization, video question answering, and text-video retrieval, as well as our earlier model, RefAtomNet. Although RefAtomNet surpasses other baselines by incorporating agent attention to highlight salient features, its ability to align and retrieve cross-modal information remains limited, leading to suboptimal performance in localizing the target person and predicting fine-grained actions. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we introduce RefAtomNet++, a novel framework that advances cross-modal token aggregation through a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention mechanism combined with multi-trajectory Mamba modeling at the partial-keyword, scene-attribute, and holistic-sentence levels. In particular, scanning trajectories are constructed by dynamically selecting the nearest visual spatial tokens at each timestep for both partial-keyword and scene-attribute levels. Moreover, we design a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention strategy, enabling more effective aggregation of spatial and temporal tokens across different semantic hierarchies. Experiments show that RefAtomNet++ establishes new state-of-the-art results. The dataset and code are released at https://github.com/KPeng9510/refAVA2.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of ECCV 2024 paper arXiv:2407.01872.

| **[Dual Learning with Dynamic Knowledge Distillation and Soft Alignment for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12283v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Almost all previous text-to-video retrieval works ideally assume that videos are pre-trimmed with short durations containing solely text-related content. However, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with much more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the given query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills generalization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language pre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR network. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic Knowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides supervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model comprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable knowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific information from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance learning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By replacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve during training, our method enables the model to better capture the fine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR. The code is available at https://github.com/HuiGuanLab/DL-DKD.</p></details> |  |
| **[TCMA: Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment for Drone Cross-Modal Text-Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10180v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become powerful platforms for real-time, high-resolution data collection, producing massive volumes of aerial videos. Efficient retrieval of relevant content from these videos is crucial for applications in urban management, emergency response, security, and disaster relief. While text-video retrieval has advanced in natural video domains, the UAV domain remains underexplored due to limitations in existing datasets, such as coarse and redundant captions. Thus, in this work, we construct the Drone Video-Text Match Dataset (DVTMD), which contains 2,864 videos and 14,320 fine-grained, semantically diverse captions. The annotations capture multiple complementary aspects, including human actions, objects, background settings, environmental conditions, and visual style, thereby enhancing text-video correspondence and reducing redundancy. Building on this dataset, we propose the Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment (TCMA) framework, which integrates global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation, and word-guided patch alignment. To further refine local alignment, we design a Word and Patch Selection module that filters irrelevant content, as well as a Text-Adaptive Dynamic Temperature Mechanism that adapts attention sharpness to text type. Extensive experiments on DVTMD and CapERA establish the first complete benchmark for drone text-video retrieval. Our TCMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, including 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8% R@1 in video-to-text retrieval, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset and method. The code and dataset will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[TransMamba: Fast Universal Architecture Adaption from Transformers to Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15130v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based architectures have become the backbone of both uni-modal and multi-modal foundation models, largely due to their scalability via attention mechanisms, resulting in a rich ecosystem of publicly available pre-trained models such as LLaVA, CLIP, and DeiT, etc. In parallel, emerging sub-quadratic architectures like Mamba offer promising efficiency gains by enabling global context modeling with linear complexity. However, training these architectures from scratch remains resource-intensive (e.g., in terms of data and time). Motivated by this challenge, we explore a cross-architecture knowledge transfer paradigm, termed TransMamba, that facilitates the reuse of Transformer pre-trained knowledge. We propose a two-stage framework to accelerate the training of Mamba-based models, ensuring their effectiveness across both uni-modal and multi-modal tasks. The first stage leverages pre-trained Transformer models to initialize critical components of the Mamba architecture. To bridge architectural and dimensional gaps, we develop a selective weight subcloning strategy and a layered initialization scheme that prioritizes the early $n$ layers. Building on this initialization, the second stage introduces an adaptive multi-directional knowledge distillation method. This mechanism employs layer-wise adaptive scaling factors to align Mamba representations with their Transformer counterparts, while accommodating the scanning order variations inherent to multi-modal Mamba architectures. Despite operating with a reduced training dataset and a more compact model architecture, TransMamba consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse mamba-based backbones (e.g., PlainMamba, Vmamba, ViM and VideoMamba) and downstream tasks (e.g., image classification, visual question answering, text-video retrieval and multimodal reasoning). All code and implementation details will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Queries Are Not Alone: Clustering Text Embeddings for Video Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07720v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of video content across various platforms has highlighted the urgent need for advanced video retrieval systems. Traditional methods, which primarily depend on directly matching textual queries with video metadata, often fail to bridge the semantic gap between text descriptions and the multifaceted nature of video content. This paper introduces a novel framework, the Video-Text Cluster (VTC), which enhances video retrieval by clustering text queries to capture a broader semantic scope. We propose a unique clustering mechanism that groups related queries, enabling our system to consider multiple interpretations and nuances of each query. This clustering is further refined by our innovative Sweeper module, which identifies and mitigates noise within these clusters. Additionally, we introduce the Video-Text Cluster-Attention (VTC-Att) mechanism, which dynamically adjusts focus within the clusters based on the video content, ensuring that the retrieval process emphasizes the most relevant textual features. Further experiments have demonstrated that our proposed model surpasses existing state-of-the-art models on five public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval 2025</p></details> |
| **[PRVR: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12510v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In current text-to-video retrieval (T2VR), videos to be retrieved have been properly trimmed so that a correspondence between the videos and ad-hoc textual queries naturally exists. Note in practice that videos circulated on the Internet and social media platforms, while being relatively short, are typically rich in their content. Often, multiple scenes / actions / events are shown in a single video, leading to a more challenging T2VR setting wherein only part of the video content is relevant w.r.t. a given query. This paper presents a first study on this setting which we term Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR). Considering that a video typically consists of multiple moments, a video is regarded as partially relevant w.r.t. to a given query if it contains a query-related moment. We formulate the PRVR task as a multiple instance learning problem, and propose a Multi-Scale Similarity Learning (MS-SL++) network that jointly learns both clip-scale and frame-scale similarities to determine the partial relevance between video-query pairs. Extensive experiments on three diverse video-text datasets (TVshow Retrieval, ActivityNet-Captions and Charades-STA) demonstrate the viability of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI.

| **[LogSTOP: Temporal Scores over Prediction Sequences for Matching and Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06512v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural models such as YOLO and HuBERT can be used to detect local properties such as objects ("car") and emotions ("angry") in individual frames of videos and audio clips respectively. The likelihood of these detections is indicated by scores in [0, 1]. Lifting these scores to temporal properties over sequences can be useful for several downstream applications such as query matching (e.g., "does the speaker eventually sound happy in this audio clip?"), and ranked retrieval (e.g., "retrieve top 5 videos with a 10 second scene where a car is detected until a pedestrian is detected"). In this work, we formalize this problem of assigning Scores for TempOral Properties (STOPs) over sequences, given potentially noisy score predictors for local properties. We then propose a scoring function called LogSTOP that can efficiently compute these scores for temporal properties represented in Linear Temporal Logic. Empirically, LogSTOP, with YOLO and HuBERT, outperforms Large Vision / Audio Language Models and other Temporal Logic-based baselines by at least 16% on query matching with temporal properties over objects-in-videos and emotions-in-speech respectively. Similarly, on ranked retrieval with temporal properties over objects and actions in videos, LogSTOP with Grounding DINO and SlowR50 reports at least a 19% and 16% increase in mean average precision and recall over zero-shot text-to-video retrieval baselines respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Watch and Learn: Learning to Use Computers from Online Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04673v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer use agents (CUAs) need to plan task workflows grounded in diverse, ever-changing applications and environments, but learning is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data in the target application. Existing datasets are domain-specific, static, and costly to annotate, while current synthetic data generation methods often yield simplistic or misaligned task demonstrations. To address these limitations, we introduce Watch & Learn (W&L), a framework that converts human demonstration videos readily available on the Internet into executable UI trajectories at scale. Instead of directly generating trajectories or relying on ad hoc reasoning heuristics, we cast the problem as an inverse dynamics objective: predicting the user's action from consecutive screen states. This formulation reduces manual engineering, is easier to learn, and generalizes more robustly across applications. Concretely, we develop an inverse dynamics labeling pipeline with task-aware video retrieval, generate over 53k high-quality trajectories from raw web videos, and demonstrate that these trajectories improve CUAs both as in-context demonstrations and as supervised training data. On the challenging OSWorld benchmark, UI trajectories extracted with W&L consistently enhance both general-purpose and state-of-the-art frameworks in-context, and deliver stronger gains for open-source models under supervised training. These results highlight web-scale human demonstration videos as a practical and scalable foundation for advancing CUAs towards real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Keyframe Layouts for Visual Known-Item Search in Homogeneous Collections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04396v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal deep-learning models power interactive video retrieval by ranking keyframes in response to textual queries. Despite these advances, users must still browse ranked candidates manually to locate a target. Keyframe arrangement within the search grid highly affects browsing effectiveness and user efficiency, yet remains underexplored. We report a study with 49 participants evaluating seven keyframe layouts for the Visual Known-Item Search task. Beyond efficiency and accuracy, we relate browsing phenomena, such as overlooks, to layout characteristics. Our results show that a video-grouped layout is the most efficient, while a four-column, rank-preserving grid achieves the highest accuracy. Sorted grids reveal potentials and trade-offs, enabling rapid scanning of uninteresting regions but down-ranking relevant targets to less prominent positions, delaying first arrival times and increasing overlooks. These findings motivate hybrid designs that preserve positions of top-ranked items while sorting or grouping the remainder, and offer guidance for searching in grids beyond video retrieval.</p></details> | 28 Pages, 17 Figures |
| **[Omni-Embed-Nemotron: A Unified Multimodal Retrieval Model for Text, Image, Audio, and Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03458v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Omni-Embed-Nemotron, a unified multimodal retrieval embedding model developed to handle the increasing complexity of real-world information needs. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced language models by incorporating external knowledge, existing text-based retrievers rely on clean, structured input and struggle with the visually and semantically rich content found in real-world documents such as PDFs, slides, or videos. Recent work such as ColPali has shown that preserving document layout using image-based representations can improve retrieval quality. Building on this, and inspired by the capabilities of recent multimodal models such as Qwen2.5-Omni, we extend retrieval beyond text and images to also support audio and video modalities. Omni-Embed-Nemotron enables both cross-modal (e.g., text - video) and joint-modal (e.g., text - video+audio) retrieval using a single model. We describe the architecture, training setup, and evaluation results of Omni-Embed-Nemotron, and demonstrate its effectiveness in text, image, and video retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with Multi-Modal Large Language Models for Text-Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23284v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval, especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood, introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM), which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text. Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks, our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4 R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors. Code is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/BLiM.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 Highlight |

However, this design presents two limitations. Low-quality text-video data pairs could compromise the retrieval, yet are hard to identify and examine. Cosine similarity alone provides no explanation for the ranking results, limiting the interpretability. We ask that can we interpret the ranking results, so as to assess the retrieval models and examine the text-video data? This work proposes X-CoT, an explainable retrieval framework upon LLM CoT reasoning in place of the embedding model-based similarity ranking. We first expand the existing benchmarks with additional video annotations to support semantic understanding and reduce data bias. We also devise a retrieval CoT consisting of pairwise comparison steps, yielding detailed reasoning and complete ranking. X-CoT empirically improves the retrieval performance and produces detailed rationales. It also facilitates the model behavior and data quality analysis. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/PrasannaPulakurthi/X-CoT.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures.

| **[ConViS-Bench: Estimating Video Similarity Through Semantic Concepts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19245v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>What does it mean for two videos to be similar? Videos may appear similar when judged by the actions they depict, yet entirely different if evaluated based on the locations where they were filmed. While humans naturally compare videos by taking different aspects into account, this ability has not been thoroughly studied and presents a challenge for models that often depend on broad global similarity scores. Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with video understanding capabilities open new opportunities for leveraging natural language in comparative video tasks. We introduce Concept-based Video Similarity estimation (ConViS), a novel task that compares pairs of videos by computing interpretable similarity scores across a predefined set of key semantic concepts. ConViS allows for human-like reasoning about video similarity and enables new applications such as concept-conditioned video retrieval. To support this task, we also introduce ConViS-Bench, a new benchmark comprising carefully annotated video pairs spanning multiple domains. Each pair comes with concept-level similarity scores and textual descriptions of both differences and similarities. Additionally, we benchmark several state-of-the-art models on ConViS, providing insights into their alignment with human judgments. Our results reveal significant performance differences on ConViS, indicating that some concepts present greater challenges for estimating video similarity. We believe that ConViS-Bench will serve as a valuable resource for advancing research in language-driven video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[VidCLearn: A Continual Learning Approach for Text-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16956v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video generation is an emerging field in generative AI, enabling the creation of realistic, semantically accurate videos from text prompts. While current models achieve impressive visual quality and alignment with input text, they typically rely on static knowledge, making it difficult to incorporate new data without retraining from scratch. To address this limitation, we propose VidCLearn, a continual learning framework for diffusion-based text-to-video generation. VidCLearn features a student-teacher architecture where the student model is incrementally updated with new text-video pairs, and the teacher model helps preserve previously learned knowledge through generative replay. Additionally, we introduce a novel temporal consistency loss to enhance motion smoothness and a video retrieval module to provide structural guidance at inference. Our architecture is also designed to be more computationally efficient than existing models while retaining satisfactory generation performance. Experimental results show VidCLearn's superiority over baseline methods in terms of visual quality, semantic alignment, and temporal coherence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Captioning for Text-Video Retrieval via Dual-Group Direct Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16560v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In text-video retrieval, auxiliary captions are often used to enhance video understanding, bridging the gap between the modalities. While recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot caption generation, we observe that such captions tend to be generic and indistinguishable across visually similar videos, limiting their utility for fine-grained retrieval. Moreover, conventional captioning approaches are typically evaluated using language generation metrics, such as BLEU, which are not typically tailored for retrieval tasks that require making discriminative distinctions between candidates. To address this, we propose $\textbf{CaRe-DPO}$, a retrieval framework that directly optimizes caption generation using retrieval relevance scores. At its core is Dual-Group Direct Preference Optimization (DG-DPO), a novel learning strategy that supervises captioning by modeling preferences across groups of distinct video and caption pairs. In addition, we present an MLLM-based retrieval model that incorporates role-embeddings to better distinguish between textual inputs with different functional roles, such as an auxiliary caption and a text query. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CaRe-DPO significantly enhances retrieval performance by effectively leveraging auxiliary knowledge to generate fine-grained captions for retrieval.

We introduce a three-stage framework, AutoArabic, utilizing state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to translate non-Arabic benchmarks into Modern Standard Arabic, reducing the manual revision required by nearly fourfold. The framework incorporates an error detection module that automatically flags potential translation errors with 97% accuracy. Applying the framework to DiDeMo, a video retrieval benchmark produces DiDeMo-AR, an Arabic variant with 40,144 fluent Arabic descriptions. An analysis of the translation errors is provided and organized into an insightful taxonomy to guide future Arabic localization efforts. We train a CLIP-style baseline with identical hyperparameters on the Arabic and English variants of the benchmark, finding a moderate performance gap (about 3 percentage points at Recall@1), indicating that Arabic localization preserves benchmark difficulty. We evaluate three post-editing budgets (zero/ flagged-only/ full) and find that performance improves monotonically with more post-editing, while the raw LLM output (zero-budget) remains usable. To ensure reproducibility to other languages, we made the code available at https://github.com/Tahaalshatiri/AutoArabic.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ArabicNLP 2025 (EMNLP 2025 workshop)</p></details> |
| **[Enhanced Partially Relevant Video Retrieval through Inter- and Intra-Sample Analysis with Coherence Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19637v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve the target video that is partially relevant to the text query. The primary challenge in PRVR arises from the semantic asymmetry between textual and visual modalities, as videos often contain substantial content irrelevant to the query. Existing methods coarsely align paired videos and text queries to construct the semantic space, neglecting the critical cross-modal dual nature inherent in this task: inter-sample correlation and intra-sample redundancy. To this end, we propose a novel PRVR framework to systematically exploit these two characteristics. Our framework consists of three core modules. First, the Inter Correlation Enhancement (ICE) module captures inter-sample correlation by identifying semantically similar yet unpaired text queries and video moments, combining them to form pseudo-positive pairs for more robust semantic space construction. Second, the Intra Redundancy Mining (IRM) module mitigates intra-sample redundancy by mining redundant moment features and distinguishing them from query-relevant moments, encouraging the model to learn more discriminative representations. Finally, to reinforce these modules, we introduce the Temporal Coherence Prediction (TCP) module, which enhances temporal structure learning by training the model to predict the original temporal order of randomly shuffled video frames and moments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to prior methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid-Tower: Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for Text-to-Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04773v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Text-to-Video Retrieval (T2VR) task aims to retrieve unlabeled videos by textual queries with the same semantic meanings. Recent CLIP-based approaches have explored two frameworks: Two-Tower versus Single-Tower framework, yet the former suffers from low effectiveness, while the latter suffers from low efficiency. In this study, we explore a new Hybrid-Tower framework that can hybridize the advantages of the Two-Tower and Single-Tower framework, achieving high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. We propose a novel hybrid method, Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for T2VR, ie, PIG, which includes a new pseudo-query generator designed to generate a pseudo-query for each video. This enables the video feature and the textual features of pseudo-query to interact in a fine-grained manner, similar to the Single-Tower approaches to hold high effectiveness, even before the real textual query is received. Simultaneously, our method introduces no additional storage or computational overhead compared to the Two-Tower framework during the inference stage, thus maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experiments on five commonly used text-video retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a significant improvement over the baseline, with an increase of $1.6\% \sim 3.9\%$ in R@1. Furthermore, our method matches the efficiency of Two-Tower models while achieving near state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the advantages of the Hybrid-Tower framework.</p></details> | Accepted to ICCV2025 |
| **[Short-Form Video Recommendations with Multimodal Embeddings: Addressing Cold-Start and Bias Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19346v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, social media users have spent significant amounts of time on short-form video platforms. As a result, established platforms in other domains, such as e-commerce, have begun introducing short-form video content to engage users and increase their time spent on the platform. The success of these experiences is due not only to the content itself but also to a unique UI innovation: instead of offering users a list of choices to click, platforms actively recommend content for users to watch one at a time. This creates new challenges for recommender systems, especially when launching a new video experience. Beyond the limited interaction data, immersive feed experiences introduce stronger position bias due to the UI and duration bias when optimizing for watch-time, as models tend to favor shorter videos. These issues, together with the feedback loop inherent in recommender systems, make it difficult to build effective solutions. In this paper, we highlight the challenges faced when introducing a new short-form video experience and present our experience showing that, even with sufficient video interaction data, it can be more beneficial to leverage a video retrieval system using a fine-tuned multimodal vision-language model to overcome these challenges. This approach demonstrated greater effectiveness compared to conventional supervised learning methods in online experiments conducted on our e-commerce platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Partially Relevant Video Retrieval with Robust Alignment Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01383v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos partially relevant to a given query. The core challenge lies in learning robust query-video alignment against spurious semantic correlations arising from inherent data uncertainty: 1) query ambiguity, where the query incompletely characterizes the target video and often contains uninformative tokens, and 2) partial video relevance, where abundant query-irrelevant segments introduce contextual noise in cross-modal alignment. Existing methods often focus on enhancing multi-scale clip representations and retrieving the most relevant clip. However, the inherent data uncertainty in PRVR renders them vulnerable to distractor videos with spurious similarities, leading to suboptimal performance. To fill this research gap, we propose Robust Alignment Learning (RAL) framework, which explicitly models the uncertainty in data. Key innovations include: 1) we pioneer probabilistic modeling for PRVR by encoding videos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions. This not only quantifies data uncertainty but also enables proxy-level matching to capture the variability in cross-modal correspondences; 2) we consider the heterogeneous informativeness of query words and introduce learnable confidence gates to dynamically weight similarity. As a plug-and-play solution, RAL can be seamlessly integrated into the existing architectures. Extensive experiments across diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce Modality Auxiliary Concepts for Video Retrieval (MAC-VR), a novel approach that leverages modality-specific tags -- automatically extracted from foundation models -- to enhance video retrieval. We propose to align modalities in a latent space, along with learning and aligning auxiliary latent concepts derived from the features of a video and its corresponding caption. We introduce these auxiliary concepts to improve the alignment of visual and textual latent concepts, allowing concepts to be distinguished from one another. We conduct extensive experiments on six diverse datasets: two different splits of MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, TGIF, Charades and YouCook2. The experimental results consistently demonstrate that modality-specific tags improve cross-modal alignment, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods across three datasets and performing comparably or better across others.

| **[Multi-Focused Video Group Activities Hashing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00490v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH (multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProPy: Building Interactive Prompt Pyramids upon CLIP for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19024v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events, ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels, and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous models by significant margins.

| **[Repeating Words for Video-Language Retrieval with Coarse-to-Fine Objectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14812v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The explosive growth of video streaming presents challenges in achieving high accuracy and low training costs for video-language retrieval. However, existing methods rely on large-scale pre-training to improve video retrieval performance, resulting in significant computational demands. Additionally, the fine-grained information in videos and texts remains underexplored. To alleviate these problems, we propose a novel framework to learn fine-grained features for better alignment and introduce an inference pipeline to improve performance without additional training. Specifically, we employ coarse-to-fine objectives to understand the semantic information of video-text pairs, including contrastive and matching learning. The fine-grained data used for training is obtained through the Granularity-Aware Representation module, which is designed based on similarity analysis between video frames and words in captions. Furthermore, we observe that the repetition of keywords in the original captions, referred to as "Repetition", can enhance retrieval performance and improve alignment between video and text. Based on this insight, we propose a novel and effective inference pipeline that incorporates a voting mechanism and a new Matching Entropy metric to achieve better retrieval performance without requiring additional pre-training. Experimental results on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous approaches. Additionally, our inference pipeline achieves significant performance improvements, with a 2.1% increase in Recall@1 on the MSR-VTT dataset and a 1.6% increase on the DiDeMo dataset.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense modification text that is around seven times more than its existing counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder, enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its efficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense modification texts.

| **[TrajSV: A Trajectory-based Model for Sports Video Representations and Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11569v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sports analytics has received significant attention from both academia and industry in recent years. Despite the growing interest and efforts in this field, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2) lack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for sufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a trajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies. TrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation Network (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data preprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports broadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to learn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet learns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual features with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive loss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an unsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast video datasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e., soccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e., sports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The results demonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports video retrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement. It outperforms baselines in action spotting, achieving state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 17 action categories, and demonstrates a nearly 20% improvement in video captioning. Additionally, we introduce a deployed system along with the three applications based on TrajSV.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by TCSVT</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal LLM-based Query Paraphrasing for Video Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12341v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video retrieval answers user queries through searches based on concepts and embeddings. However, due to limitations in the size of the concept bank and the amount of training data, answering queries in the wild is not always effective because of the out-of-vocabulary problem. Furthermore, neither concept-based nor embedding-based search can perform reasoning to consolidate search results for complex queries that include logical and spatial constraints. To address these challenges, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to paraphrase queries using text-to-text (T2T), text-to-image (T2I), and image-to-text (I2T) transformations. These transformations rephrase abstract concepts into simpler terms to mitigate the out-of-vocabulary problem. Additionally, complex relationships within a query can be decomposed into simpler sub-queries, improving retrieval performance by effectively fusing the search results of these sub-queries. To mitigate the issue of LLM hallucination, this paper also proposes a novel consistency-based verification strategy to filter out factually incorrect paraphrased queries. Extensive experiments are conducted for ad-hoc video search and known-item search on the TRECVid datasets. We provide empirical insights into how traditionally difficult-to-answer queries can be effectively resolved through query paraphrasing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Video Promotion Against Text-to-Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06964v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thanks to the development of cross-modal models, text-to-video retrieval (T2VR) is advancing rapidly, but its robustness remains largely unexamined. Existing attacks against T2VR are designed to push videos away from queries, i.e., suppressing the ranks of videos, while the attacks that pull videos towards selected queries, i.e., promoting the ranks of videos, remain largely unexplored. These attacks can be more impactful as attackers may gain more views/clicks for financial benefits and widespread (mis)information. To this end, we pioneer the first attack against T2VR to promote videos adversarially, dubbed the Video Promotion attack (ViPro). We further propose Modal Refinement (MoRe) to capture the finer-grained, intricate interaction between visual and textual modalities to enhance black-box transferability. Comprehensive experiments cover 2 existing baselines, 3 leading T2VR models, 3 prevailing datasets with over 10k videos, evaluated under 3 scenarios. All experiments are conducted in a multi-target setting to reflect realistic scenarios where attackers seek to promote the video regarding multiple queries simultaneously. We also evaluated our attacks for defences and imperceptibility. Overall, ViPro surpasses other baselines by over $30/10/4\%$ for white/grey/black-box settings on average. Our work highlights an overlooked vulnerability, provides a qualitative analysis on the upper/lower bound of our attacks, and offers insights into potential counterplays. Code will be publicly available at https://github.com/michaeltian108/ViPro.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods predominantly exploit visual cues and often overlook complementary audio semantics or adopt coarse fusion strategies, leading to suboptimal multimodal representations. We present GAID, a framework that jointly address this gap via two key components: (i) a Frame-level Gated Fusion (FGF) that adaptively integrates audio and visual features under textual guidance, enabling fine-grained temporal alignment; and (ii) a Directional Adaptive Semantic Perturbation (DASP) that injects structure-aware perturbations into text embeddings, enhancing robustness and discrimination without incurring multi-pass inference. These modules complement each other -- fusion reduces modality gaps while perturbation regularizes cross-modal matching -- yielding more stable and expressive representations. Extensive experiments on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and VATEX show consistent state-of-the-art results across all retrieval metrics with notable efficiency gains.

| **[Generative Ghost: Investigating Ranking Bias Hidden in AI-Generated Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07327v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC), the creation of high-quality AI-generated videos has become faster and easier, resulting in the Internet being flooded with all kinds of video content. However, the impact of these videos on the content ecosystem remains largely unexplored. Video information retrieval remains a fundamental approach for accessing video content. Building on the observation that retrieval models often favor AI-generated content in ad-hoc and image retrieval tasks, we investigate whether similar biases emerge in the context of challenging video retrieval, where temporal and visual factors may further influence model behavior. To explore this, we first construct a comprehensive benchmark dataset containing both real and AI-generated videos, along with a set of fair and rigorous metrics to assess bias. This benchmark consists of 13,000 videos generated by two state-of-the-art open-source video generation models. We meticulously design a suite of rigorous metrics to accurately measure this preference, accounting for potential biases arising from the limited frame rate and suboptimal quality of AIGC videos. We then applied three off-the-shelf video retrieval models to perform retrieval tasks on this hybrid dataset. Our findings reveal a clear preference for AI-generated videos in retrieval. Further investigation shows that incorporating AI-generated videos into the training set of retrieval models exacerbates this bias. Unlike the preference observed in image modalities, we find that video retrieval bias arises from both unseen visual and temporal information, making the root causes of video bias a complex interplay of these two factors. To mitigate this bias, we fine-tune the retrieval models using a contrastive learning approach. The results of this study highlight the potential implications of AI-generated videos on retrieval systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, Accepted at ACMMM2025</p></details> |
| **[T2VParser: Adaptive Decomposition Tokens for Partial Alignment in Text to Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20518v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video retrieval essentially aims to train models to align visual content with textual descriptions accurately. Due to the impressive general multimodal knowledge demonstrated by image-text pretrained models such as CLIP, existing work has primarily focused on extending CLIP knowledge for video-text tasks. However, videos typically contain richer information than images. In current video-text datasets, textual descriptions can only reflect a portion of the video content, leading to partial misalignment in video-text matching. Therefore, directly aligning text representations with video representations can result in incorrect supervision, ignoring the inequivalence of information. In this work, we propose T2VParser to extract multiview semantic representations from text and video, achieving adaptive semantic alignment rather than aligning the entire representation. To extract corresponding representations from different modalities, we introduce Adaptive Decomposition Tokens, which consist of a set of learnable tokens shared across modalities. The goal of T2VParser is to emphasize precise alignment between text and video while retaining the knowledge of pretrained models. Experimental results demonstrate that T2VParser achieves accurate partial alignment through effective cross-modal content decomposition. The code is available at https://github.com/Lilidamowang/T2VParser.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods suffer from geometric distortion in Euclidean space that sometimes misrepresents the intrinsic hierarchical structure of videos and overlooks certain hierarchical semantics, ultimately leading to suboptimal temporal modeling. To address this issue, we propose the first hyperbolic modeling framework for PRVR, namely HLFormer, which leverages hyperbolic space learning to compensate for the suboptimal hierarchical modeling capabilities of Euclidean space. Specifically, HLFormer integrates the Lorentz Attention Block and Euclidean Attention Block to encode video embeddings in hybrid spaces, using the Mean-Guided Adaptive Interaction Module to dynamically fuse features. Additionally, we introduce a Partial Order Preservation Loss to enforce "text < video" hierarchy through Lorentzian cone constraints. This approach further enhances cross-modal matching by reinforcing partial relevance between video content and text queries. Extensive experiments show that HLFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

| **[FrameFusion: Combining Similarity and Importance for Video Token Reduction on Large Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01986v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand to process long and high-resolution videos significantly burdens Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the enormous number of visual tokens. Existing token reduction methods primarily prune tokens based on importance metrics, such as cumulative attention scores. However, even important tokens may exhibit high redundancy caused by similarity among adjacent video frames and repetitive visual elements. To address this limitation, we propose FrameFusion, a novel token reduction approach integrating similarity-based merging with importance-based pruning. We conduct a thorough study on token similarity characteristics, revealing three key insights: (1) spatially corresponding visual tokens between adjacent frames have higher cosine similarities compared to other token pairs; (2) high token similarities prominently decrease in deeper model layers; and (3) token similarity rankings are highly consistent across different layers. Guided by these observations, FrameFusion computes token similarities exclusively between corresponding visual tokens from adjacent frames, applies token merging at initial successive layers followed by pruning in deeper layers, and adopts a cascaded merging strategy to further enhance efficiency. We evaluate FrameFusion comprehensively across six diverse LVLMs, ranging from 2B to 72B parameters, using five video benchmarks encompassing video retrieval, question-answering, and spatial-temporal understanding tasks. Experiments show that FrameFusion reduces visual tokens by 70%, achieving 1.6-3.6x end-to-end speedups, with an average performance impact of less than 3%.

Although interactive systems have emerged to address these challenges by refining user intent through clarifying questions, current methods typically rely on heuristic or ad-hoc strategies without explicitly quantifying these uncertainties, limiting their effectiveness. Motivated by this gap, we propose UMIVR, an Uncertainty-Minimizing Interactive Text-to-Video Retrieval framework that explicitly quantifies three critical uncertainties-text ambiguity, mapping uncertainty, and frame uncertainty-via principled, training-free metrics: semantic entropy-based Text Ambiguity Score (TAS), Jensen-Shannon divergence-based Mapping Uncertainty Score (MUS), and a Temporal Quality-based Frame Sampler (TQFS). By adaptively generating targeted clarifying questions guided by these uncertainty measures, UMIVR iteratively refines user queries, significantly reducing retrieval ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate UMIVR's effectiveness, achieving notable gains in Recall@1 (69.2\% after 10 interactive rounds) on the MSR-VTT-1k dataset, thereby establishing an uncertainty-minimizing foundation for interactive TVR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Yet, existing methods face a critical challenge in balancing accuracy and computational efficiency: uniform frame sampling methods ensure content coverage but incur prohibitive computational costs, while salient-frame sampling methods reduce overhead but suffer from query-agnostic frame selection that biases retrieval results. To address this, we propose ProCLIP, a user-centric framework that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly improved efficiency. We design a prompt-aware frame sampling strategy that dynamically guides lightweight feature extractors using textual prompts to select semantically relevant frames, overcoming the limitations of existing salient-frame sampling methods which rely on static, query-agnostic selection criteria. Moreover, we adopt a two-stage candidate pruning strategy that combines rapid coarse filtering via a lightweight module with CLIP-powered fine-grained re-ranking, enhancing retrieval efficiency while preserving accuracy. Experiments across benchmarks show ProCLIP achieves 75.3% latency reduction versus baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy, i.e., R@1=49.0 in MSR-VTT dataset.

Despite their success, the mechanisms underlying their retrieval capabilities remain largely unexplored, potentially resulting in suboptimal performance and limited generalization ability. To address these issues, we present a comprehensive study aimed at uncovering the key factors that drive effective embedding learning for UMR using MLLMs. We begin by implementing a general MLLM-based embedding learning pipeline, and systematically analyze the primary contributors to high-performing universal retrieval systems. Based on this, we explore various aspects of the details in embedding generation and training strategies, including progressive transition, hard negative mining and re-ranker distillation. Notably, our findings reveal that often-overlooked factors can have a substantial impact on model performance. Building on these discoveries, we introduce a unified framework termed U-MARVEL (\textbf{U}niversal \textbf{M}ultimod\textbf{A}l \textbf{R}etrie\textbf{V}al via \textbf{E}mbedding \textbf{L}earning), which outperforms state-of-the-art competitors on the M-BEIR benchmark by a large margin in supervised settings, and also exihibits strong zero-shot performance on several tasks such as composed image retrieval and text-to-video retrieval.

While dense text captions can achieve 75.9% Recall@5, they require expensive offline processing and miss critical visual information present in 34% of clips with scene text not captured by ASR. By analyzing query intent and predicting information needs, ModaRoute reduces computational overhead by 41% while achieving 60.9% Recall@5. Our approach uses GPT-4.1 to route queries across ASR (speech), OCR (text), and visual indices, averaging 1.78 modalities per query versus exhaustive 3.0 modality search. Evaluation on 1.8M video clips demonstrates that intelligent routing provides a practical solution for scaling multimodal retrieval systems, reducing infrastructure costs while maintaining competitive effectiveness for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025 Multimodal Representation and Retrieval Workshop</p></details> |
| **[MSVD-Indonesian: A Benchmark for Multimodal Video-Text Tasks in Indonesian](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11341v2)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning on video and text has seen significant progress, particularly in tasks like text-to-video retrieval, video-to-text retrieval, and video captioning. However, most existing methods and datasets focus exclusively on English. Despite Indonesian being one of the most widely spoken languages, multimodal research in Indonesian remains under-explored, largely due to the lack of benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the first public Indonesian video-text dataset by translating the English captions in the MSVD dataset into Indonesian. Using this dataset, we evaluate neural network models which were developed for the English video-text dataset on three tasks, i.e., text-to-video retrieval, video-to-text retrieval, and video captioning. Most existing models rely on feature extractors pretrained on English vision-language datasets, raising concerns about their applicability to Indonesian, given the scarcity of large-scale pretraining resources in the language. We apply a cross-lingual transfer learning approach by leveraging English-pretrained extractors and fine-tuning models on our Indonesian dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy improves performance across all tasks and metrics. We release our dataset publicly to support future research and hope it will inspire further progress in Indonesian multimodal learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[BiMa: Towards Biases Mitigation for Text-Video Retrieval via Scene Element Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03589v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-video retrieval (TVR) systems often suffer from visual-linguistic biases present in datasets, which cause pre-trained vision-language models to overlook key details. To address this, we propose BiMa, a novel framework designed to mitigate biases in both visual and textual representations. Our approach begins by generating scene elements that characterize each video by identifying relevant entities/objects and activities. For visual debiasing, we integrate these scene elements into the video embeddings, enhancing them to emphasize fine-grained and salient details. For textual debiasing, we introduce a mechanism to disentangle text features into content and bias components, enabling the model to focus on meaningful content while separately handling biased information. Extensive experiments and ablation studies across five major TVR benchmarks (i.e., MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, ActivityNet, and DiDeMo) demonstrate the competitive performance of BiMa. Additionally, the model's bias mitigation capability is consistently validated by its strong results on out-of-distribution retrieval tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[VLM2Vec-V2: Advancing Multimodal Embedding for Videos, Images, and Visual Documents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04590v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal embedding models have been crucial in enabling various downstream tasks such as semantic similarity, information retrieval, and clustering over different modalities. However, existing multimodal embeddings like VLM2Vec, E5-V, GME are predominantly focused on natural images, with limited support for other visual forms such as videos and visual documents. This restricts their applicability in real-world scenarios, including AI agents, multi-modal search and recommendation, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To close this gap, we propose VLM2Vec-V2, a unified framework for learning embeddings across diverse visual forms. First, we introduce MMEB-V2, a comprehensive benchmark that extends MMEB with five new task types: visual document retrieval, video retrieval, temporal grounding, video classification and video question answering - spanning text, image, video, and visual document inputs. Next, we train VLM2Vec-V2, a general-purpose embedding model that supports text, image, video, and visual document inputs. Extensive experiments show that VLM2Vec-V2 achieves strong performance not only on the newly introduced video and document retrieval tasks, but also improves over prior baselines on the original image benchmarks. Through extensive evaluation, our study offers insights into the generalizability of various multimodal embedding models and highlights effective strategies for unified embedding learning, laying the groundwork for more scalable and adaptable representation learning in both research and real-world settings.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[Are Synthetic Videos Useful? A Benchmark for Retrieval-Centric Evaluation of Synthetic Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02316v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis has advanced rapidly, yet current evaluation metrics primarily capture visual quality and temporal consistency, offering limited insight into how synthetic videos perform in downstream tasks such as text-to-video retrieval (TVR). In this work, we introduce SynTVA, a new dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate the utility of synthetic videos for building retrieval models. Based on 800 diverse user queries derived from MSRVTT training split, we generate synthetic videos using state-of-the-art T2V models and annotate each video-text pair along four key semantic alignment dimensions: Object \& Scene, Action, Attribute, and Prompt Fidelity. Our evaluation framework correlates general video quality assessment (VQA) metrics with these alignment scores, and examines their predictive power for downstream TVR performance. To explore pathways of scaling up, we further develop an Auto-Evaluator to estimate alignment quality from existing metrics. Beyond benchmarking, our results show that SynTVA is a valuable asset for dataset augmentation, enabling the selection of high-utility synthetic samples that measurably improve TVR outcomes.

| **[Embedding-based Retrieval in Multimodal Content Moderation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01066v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video understanding plays a fundamental role for content moderation on short video platforms, enabling the detection of inappropriate content. While classification remains the dominant approach for content moderation, it often struggles in scenarios requiring rapid and cost-efficient responses, such as trend adaptation and urgent escalations. To address this issue, we introduce an Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) method designed to complement traditional classification approaches. We first leverage a Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL) framework to train a suite of foundation embedding models, including both single-modal and multi-modal architectures. Our models demonstrate superior performance over established contrastive learning methods such as CLIP and MoCo. Building on these embedding models, we design and implement the embedding-based retrieval system that integrates embedding generation and video retrieval to enable efficient and effective trend handling. Comprehensive offline experiments on 25 diverse emerging trends show that EBR improves ROC-AUC from 0.85 to 0.99 and PR-AUC from 0.35 to 0.95. Further online experiments reveal that EBR increases action rates by 10.32% and reduces operational costs by over 80%, while also enhancing interpretability and flexibility compared to classification-based solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera ready for SIGIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[ViFusion: In-Network Tensor Fusion for Scalable Video Feature Indexing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16258v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale video feature indexing in datacenters is critically dependent on efficient data transfer. Although in-network computation has emerged as a compelling strategy for accelerating feature extraction and reducing overhead in distributed multimedia systems, harnessing advanced networking resources at both the switch and host levels remains a formidable challenge. These difficulties are compounded by heterogeneous hardware, diverse application requirements, and complex multipath topologies. Existing methods focus primarily on optimizing inference for large neural network models using specialized collective communication libraries, which often face performance degradation in network congestion scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we present ViFusion, a communication aware tensor fusion framework that streamlines distributed video indexing by merging numerous small feature tensors into consolidated and more manageable units. By integrating an in-network computation module and a dedicated tensor fusion mechanism within datacenter environments, ViFusion substantially improves the efficiency of video feature indexing workflows. The deployment results show that ViFusion improves the throughput of the video retrieval system by 8--22 times with the same level of latency as state-of-the-art systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAGNET: A Multi-agent Framework for Finding Audio-Visual Needles by Reasoning over Multi-Video Haystacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07016v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown remarkable progress in audio-visual understanding, yet they struggle with real-world scenarios that require complex reasoning across extensive video collections. Existing benchmarks for video question answering remain limited in scope, typically involving one clip per query, which falls short of representing the challenges of large-scale, audio-visual retrieval and reasoning encountered in practical applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task named AV-HaystacksQA, where the goal is to identify salient segments across different videos in response to a query and link them together to generate the most informative answer. To this end, we present AVHaystacks, an audio-visual benchmark comprising 3100 annotated QA pairs designed to assess the capabilities of LMMs in multi-video retrieval and temporal grounding task. Additionally, we propose a model-agnostic, multi-agent framework MAGNET to address this challenge, achieving up to 89% and 65% relative improvements over baseline methods on BLEU@4 and GPT evaluation scores in QA task on our proposed AVHaystacks. To enable robust evaluation of multi-video retrieval and temporal grounding for optimal response generation, we introduce two new metrics, STEM, which captures alignment errors between a ground truth and a predicted step sequence and MTGS, to facilitate balanced and interpretable evaluation of segment-level grounding performance.

In this work, we consider how we can improve the identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore unified retrieval methods using OmniEmbed, a powerful multimodal embedding model from the Tevatron 2.0 toolkit, in the context of the MAGMaR shared task. Evaluated on the comprehensive MultiVENT 2.0 dataset, OmniEmbed generates unified embeddings for text, images, audio, and video, enabling robust multimodal retrieval. By finetuning OmniEmbed with the combined multimodal data--visual frames, audio tracks, and textual descriptions provided in MultiVENT 2.0, we achieve substantial improvements in complex, multilingual video retrieval tasks. Our submission achieved the highest score on the MAGMaR shared task leaderboard among public submissions as of May 20th, 2025, highlighting the practical effectiveness of our unified multimodal retrieval approach.

| **[Ambiguity-Restrained Text-Video Representation Learning for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07471v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partially Relevant Video Retrieval~(PRVR) aims to retrieve a video where a specific segment is relevant to a given text query. Typical training processes of PRVR assume a one-to-one relationship where each text query is relevant to only one video. However, we point out the inherent ambiguity between text and video content based on their conceptual scope and propose a framework that incorporates this ambiguity into the model learning process. Specifically, we propose Ambiguity-Restrained representation Learning~(ARL) to address ambiguous text-video pairs. Initially, ARL detects ambiguous pairs based on two criteria: uncertainty and similarity. Uncertainty represents whether instances include commonly shared context across the dataset, while similarity indicates pair-wise semantic overlap. Then, with the detected ambiguous pairs, our ARL hierarchically learns the semantic relationship via multi-positive contrastive learning and dual triplet margin loss. Additionally, we delve into fine-grained relationships within the video instances. Unlike typical training at the text-video level, where pairwise information is provided, we address the inherent ambiguity within frames of the same untrimmed video, which often contains multiple contexts. This allows us to further enhance learning at the text-frame level. Lastly, we propose cross-model ambiguity detection to mitigate the error propagation that occurs when a single model is employed to detect ambiguous pairs for its training. With all components combined, our proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness in PRVR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[From Play to Replay: Composed Video Retrieval for Temporally Fine-Grained Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05274v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) retrieves a target video given a query video and a modification text describing the intended change. Existing CoVR benchmarks emphasize appearance shifts or coarse event changes and therefore do not test the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences. We introduce TF-CoVR, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to temporally fine-grained CoVR. TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K triplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing on temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the same video, limiting practical usefulness. In TF-CoVR, we instead construct each <query, modification> pair by prompting an LLM with the label differences between clips drawn from different videos; every pair is thus associated with multiple valid target videos (3.9 on average), reflecting real-world tasks such as sports-highlight generation. To model these temporal dynamics we propose TF-CoVR-Base, a concise two-stage training framework: (i) pre-train a video encoder on fine-grained action classification to obtain temporally discriminative embeddings; (ii) align the composed query with candidate videos using contrastive learning. We conduct the first comprehensive study of image, video, and general multimodal embedding (GME) models on temporally fine-grained composed retrieval in both zero-shot and fine-tuning regimes. On TF-CoVR, TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 (LanguageBind) to 7.51, and after fine-tuning raises the state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 25.82.</p></details> |  |
| **[MamFusion: Multi-Mamba with Temporal Fusion for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03473v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a challenging task in the domain of multimedia retrieval. It is designed to identify and retrieve untrimmed videos that are partially relevant to the provided query. In this work, we investigate long-sequence video content understanding to address information redundancy issues. Leveraging the outstanding long-term state space modeling capability and linear scalability of the Mamba module, we introduce a multi-Mamba module with temporal fusion framework (MamFusion) tailored for PRVR task. This framework effectively captures the state-relatedness in long-term video content and seamlessly integrates it into text-video relevance understanding, thereby enhancing the retrieval process. Specifically, we introduce Temporal T-to-V Fusion and Temporal V-to-T Fusion to explicitly model temporal relationships between text queries and video moments, improving contextual awareness and retrieval accuracy. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale datasets demonstrate that MamFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in retrieval effectiveness.

| **[Uneven Event Modeling for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00891v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a text query, partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant moments, wherein event modeling is crucial for partitioning the video into smaller temporal events that partially correspond to the text. Previous methods typically segment videos into a fixed number of equal-length clips, resulting in ambiguous event boundaries. Additionally, they rely on mean pooling to compute event representations, inevitably introducing undesired misalignment. To address these, we propose an Uneven Event Modeling (UEM) framework for PRVR. We first introduce the Progressive-Grouped Video Segmentation (PGVS) module, to iteratively formulate events in light of both temporal dependencies and semantic similarity between consecutive frames, enabling clear event boundaries. Furthermore, we also propose the Context-Aware Event Refinement (CAER) module to refine the event representation conditioned the text's cross-attention. This enables event representations to focus on the most relevant frames for a given text, facilitating more precise text-video alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two PRVR benchmarks.

However, existing query-answer datasets primarily focus on textual responses, making it challenging to address complex user queries that require visual demonstrations or explanations for better understanding. To bridge this gap, we construct a benchmark, RealVideoQuest, designed to evaluate the abilities of text-to-video (T2V) models in answering real-world, visually grounded queries. It identifies 7.5K real user queries with video response intents from Chatbot-Arena and builds 4.5K high-quality query-video pairs through a multistage video retrieval and refinement process. We further develop a multi-angle evaluation system to assess the quality of generated video answers. Experiments indicate that current T2V models struggle with effectively addressing real user queries, pointing to key challenges and future research opportunities in multimodal AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoRoPE: What Makes for Good Video Rotary Position Embedding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05173v3)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and its variants are widely adopted for their long-context capabilities, the extension of the 1D RoPE to video, with its complex spatio-temporal structure, remains an open challenge. This work first introduces a comprehensive analysis that identifies four key characteristics essential for the effective adaptation of RoPE to video, which have not been fully considered in prior work. As part of our analysis, we introduce a challenging V-NIAH-D (Visual Needle-In-A-Haystack with Distractors) task, which adds periodic distractors into V-NIAH. The V-NIAH-D task demonstrates that previous RoPE variants, lacking appropriate temporal dimension allocation, are easily misled by distractors. Based on our analysis, we introduce \textbf{VideoRoPE}, with a \textit{3D structure} designed to preserve spatio-temporal relationships. VideoRoPE features \textit{low-frequency temporal allocation} to mitigate periodic oscillations, a \textit{diagonal layout} to maintain spatial symmetry, and \textit{adjustable temporal spacing} to decouple temporal and spatial indexing. VideoRoPE consistently surpasses previous RoPE variants, across diverse downstream tasks such as long video retrieval, video understanding, and video hallucination.

| **[Leveraging Auxiliary Information in Text-to-Video Retrieval: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23952v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Video (T2V) retrieval aims to identify the most relevant item from a gallery of videos based on a user's text query. Traditional methods rely solely on aligning video and text modalities to compute the similarity and retrieve relevant items. However, recent advancements emphasise incorporating auxiliary information extracted from video and text modalities to improve retrieval performance and bridge the semantic gap between these modalities. Auxiliary information can include visual attributes, such as objects; temporal and spatial context; and textual descriptions, such as speech and rephrased captions. This survey comprehensively reviews 81 research papers on Text-to-Video retrieval that utilise such auxiliary information. It provides a detailed analysis of their methodologies; highlights state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets; and discusses available datasets and their auxiliary information. Additionally, it proposes promising directions for future research, focusing on different ways to further enhance retrieval performance using this information.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoVR: A Benchmark for Long Video Retrieval in Multimodal Contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13928v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long videos contain a vast amount of information, making video-text retrieval an essential and challenging task in multimodal learning. However, existing benchmarks suffer from limited video duration, low-quality captions, and coarse annotation granularity, which hinder the evaluation of advanced video-text retrieval methods. To address these limitations, we introduce LoVR, a benchmark specifically designed for long video-text retrieval. LoVR contains 467 long videos and over 40,804 fine-grained clips with high-quality captions. To overcome the issue of poor machine-generated annotations, we propose an efficient caption generation framework that integrates VLM automatic generation, caption quality scoring, and dynamic refinement. This pipeline improves annotation accuracy while maintaining scalability. Furthermore, we introduce a semantic fusion method to generate coherent full-video captions without losing important contextual information. Our benchmark introduces longer videos, more detailed captions, and a larger-scale dataset, presenting new challenges for video understanding and retrieval. Extensive experiments on various advanced embedding models demonstrate that LoVR is a challenging benchmark, revealing the limitations of current approaches and providing valuable insights for future research. We release the code and dataset link at https://github.com/TechNomad-ds/LoVR-benchmark</p></details> |  |
| **[MomentSeeker: A Task-Oriented Benchmark For Long-Video Moment Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12558v4)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately locating key moments within long videos is crucial for solving long video understanding (LVU) tasks. However, existing benchmarks are either severely limited in terms of video length and task diversity, or they focus solely on the end-to-end LVU performance, making them inappropriate for evaluating whether key moments can be accurately accessed. To address this challenge, we propose MomentSeeker, a novel benchmark for long-video moment retrieval (LMVR), distinguished by the following features. First, it is created based on long and diverse videos, averaging over 1200 seconds in duration and collected from various domains, e.g., movie, anomaly, egocentric, and sports. Second, it covers a variety of real-world scenarios in three levels: global-level, event-level, object-level, covering common tasks like action recognition, object localization, and causal reasoning, etc. Third, it incorporates rich forms of queries, including text-only queries, image-conditioned queries, and video-conditioned queries. On top of MomentSeeker, we conduct comprehensive experiments for both generation-based approaches (directly using MLLMs) and retrieval-based approaches (leveraging video retrievers). Our results reveal the significant challenges in long-video moment retrieval in terms of accuracy and efficiency, despite improvements from the latest long-video MLLMs and task-specific fine-tuning. We have publicly released MomentSeeker(https://yhy-2000.github.io/MomentSeeker/) to facilitate future research in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Challenge to Build Neuro-Symbolic Video Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13851v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern video understanding systems excel at tasks such as scene classification, object detection, and short video retrieval. However, as video analysis becomes increasingly central to real-world applications, there is a growing need for proactive video agents for the systems that not only interpret video streams but also reason about events and take informed actions. A key obstacle in this direction is temporal reasoning: while deep learning models have made remarkable progress in recognizing patterns within individual frames or short clips, they struggle to understand the sequencing and dependencies of events over time, which is critical for action-driven decision-making. Addressing this limitation demands moving beyond conventional deep learning approaches. We posit that tackling this challenge requires a neuro-symbolic perspective, where video queries are decomposed into atomic events, structured into coherent sequences, and validated against temporal constraints. Such an approach can enhance interpretability, enable structured reasoning, and provide stronger guarantees on system behavior, all key properties for advancing trustworthy video agents. To this end, we present a grand challenge to the research community: developing the next generation of intelligent video agents that integrate three core capabilities: (1) autonomous video search and analysis, (2) seamless real-world interaction, and (3) advanced content generation. By addressing these pillars, we can transition from passive perception to intelligent video agents that reason, predict, and act, pushing the boundaries of video understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[CMAWRNet: Multiple Adverse Weather Removal via a Unified Quaternion Neural Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01882v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Images used in real-world applications such as image or video retrieval, outdoor surveillance, and autonomous driving suffer from poor weather conditions. When designing robust computer vision systems, removing adverse weather such as haze, rain, and snow is a significant problem. Recently, deep-learning methods offered a solution for a single type of degradation. Current state-of-the-art universal methods struggle with combinations of degradations, such as haze and rain-streak. Few algorithms have been developed that perform well when presented with images containing multiple adverse weather conditions. This work focuses on developing an efficient solution for multiple adverse weather removal using a unified quaternion neural architecture called CMAWRNet. It is based on a novel texture-structure decomposition block, a novel lightweight encoder-decoder quaternion transformer architecture, and an attentive fusion block with low-light correction. We also introduce a quaternion similarity loss function to preserve color information better. The quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the current state-of-the-art benchmarking datasets and real-world images shows the performance advantages of the proposed CMAWRNet compared to other state-of-the-art weather removal approaches dealing with multiple weather artifacts. Extensive computer simulations validate that CMAWRNet improves the performance of downstream applications such as object detection. This is the first time the decomposition approach has been applied to the universal weather removal task.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReSpec: Relevance and Specificity Grounded Online Filtering for Learning on Video-Text Data Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14875v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of video-text data presents challenges in storage and computation during training. Online learning, which processes streaming data in real-time, offers a promising solution to these issues while also allowing swift adaptations in scenarios demanding real-time responsiveness. One strategy to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of learning involves identifying and prioritizing data that enhances performance on target downstream tasks. We propose Relevance and Specificity-based online filtering framework (ReSpec) that selects data based on four criteria: (i) modality alignment for clean data, (ii) task relevance for target focused data, (iii) specificity for informative and detailed data, and (iv) efficiency for low-latency processing. Relevance is determined by the probabilistic alignment of incoming data with downstream tasks, while specificity employs the distance to a root embedding representing the least specific data as an efficient proxy for informativeness. By establishing reference points from target task data, ReSpec filters incoming data in real-time, eliminating the need for extensive storage and compute. Evaluating on large-scale datasets WebVid2M and VideoCC3M, ReSpec attains state-of-the-art performance on five zeroshot video retrieval tasks, using as little as 5% of the data while incurring minimal compute. The source code is available at https://github.com/cdjkim/ReSpec.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 (main conference)</p></details> |
| **[Prototypes are Balanced Units for Efficient and Effective Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13035v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a retrieval system, simultaneously achieving search accuracy and efficiency is inherently challenging. This challenge is particularly pronounced in partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR), where incorporating more diverse context representations at varying temporal scales for each video enhances accuracy but increases computational and memory costs. To address this dichotomy, we propose a prototypical PRVR framework that encodes diverse contexts within a video into a fixed number of prototypes. We then introduce several strategies to enhance text association and video understanding within the prototypes, along with an orthogonal objective to ensure that the prototypes capture a diverse range of content. To keep the prototypes searchable via text queries while accurately encoding video contexts, we implement cross- and uni-modal reconstruction tasks. The cross-modal reconstruction task aligns the prototypes with textual features within a shared space, while the uni-modal reconstruction task preserves all video contexts during encoding. Additionally, we employ a video mixing technique to provide weak guidance to further align prototypes and associated textual representations. Extensive evaluations on TVR, ActivityNet-Captions, and QVHighlights validate the effectiveness of our approach without sacrificing efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Efficient Partially Relevant Video Retrieval with Active Moment Discovering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10920v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task in text-to-video retrieval, where videos are untrimmed and contain much background content. The pursuit here is of both effective and efficient solutions to capture the partial correspondence between text queries and untrimmed videos. Existing PRVR methods, which typically focus on modeling multi-scale clip representations, however, suffer from content independence and information redundancy, impairing retrieval performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective approach with active moment discovering (AMDNet). We are committed to discovering video moments that are semantically consistent with their queries. By using learnable span anchors to capture distinct moments and applying masked multi-moment attention to emphasize salient moments while suppressing redundant backgrounds, we achieve more compact and informative video representations. To further enhance moment modeling, we introduce a moment diversity loss to encourage different moments of distinct regions and a moment relevance loss to promote semantically query-relevant moments, which cooperate with a partially relevant retrieval loss for end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on two large-scale video datasets (\ie, TVR and ActivityNet Captions) demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of our AMDNet. In particular, AMDNet is about 15.5 times smaller (\#parameters) while 6.0 points higher (SumR) than the up-to-date method GMMFormer on TVR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM) on January 19, 2025.

| **[A Lightweight Moment Retrieval System with Global Re-Ranking and Robust Adaptive Bidirectional Temporal Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09298v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth of digital video content has posed critical challenges in moment-level video retrieval, where existing methodologies struggle to efficiently localize specific segments within an expansive video corpus. Current retrieval systems are constrained by computational inefficiencies, temporal context limitations, and the intrinsic complexity of navigating video content. In this paper, we address these limitations through a novel Interactive Video Corpus Moment Retrieval framework that integrates a SuperGlobal Reranking mechanism and Adaptive Bidirectional Temporal Search (ABTS), strategically optimizing query similarity, temporal stability, and computational resources. By preprocessing a large corpus of videos using a keyframe extraction model and deduplication technique through image hashing, our approach provides a scalable solution that significantly reduces storage requirements while maintaining high localization precision across diverse video repositories.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods for skill-assessment from video only provide scores or compare demonstrations, leaving the burden of knowing what to do differently on the user. We introduce a novel method to generate actionable feedback (AF) from video of a person doing a physical activity, such as basketball or soccer. Our method takes a video demonstration and its accompanying 3D body pose and generates (1) free-form expert commentary describing what the person is doing well and what they could improve, and (2) a visual expert demonstration that incorporates the required corrections. We show how to leverage Ego-Exo4D's [29] videos of skilled activity and expert commentary together with a strong language model to create a weakly-supervised training dataset for this task, and we devise a multimodal video-language model to infer coaching feedback. Our method is able to reason across multi-modal input combinations to output full spectrum, actionable coaching-expert commentary, expert video retrieval, and expert pose generation-outperforming strong vision-language models on both established metrics and human preference studies.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Towards Efficient and Robust Moment Retrieval System: A Unified Framework for Multi-Granularity Models and Temporal Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08384v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-form video understanding presents significant challenges for interactive retrieval systems, as conventional methods struggle to process extensive video content efficiently. Existing approaches often rely on single models, inefficient storage, unstable temporal search, and context-agnostic reranking, limiting their effectiveness. This paper presents a novel framework to enhance interactive video retrieval through four key innovations: (1) an ensemble search strategy that integrates coarse-grained (CLIP) and fine-grained (BEIT3) models to improve retrieval accuracy, (2) a storage optimization technique that reduces redundancy by selecting representative keyframes via TransNetV2 and deduplication, (3) a temporal search mechanism that localizes video segments using dual queries for start and end points, and (4) a temporal reranking approach that leverages neighboring frame context to stabilize rankings. Evaluated on known-item search and question-answering tasks, our framework demonstrates substantial improvements in retrieval precision, efficiency, and user interpretability, offering a robust solution for real-world interactive video retrieval applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continual Text-to-Video Retrieval with Frame Fusion and Task-Aware Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10111v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Video Retrieval (TVR) aims to retrieve relevant videos based on textual queries. However, as video content evolves continuously, adapting TVR systems to new data remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark for Continual Text-to-Video Retrieval (CTVR) to address the limitations of existing approaches. Current Pre-Trained Model (PTM)-based TVR methods struggle with maintaining model plasticity when adapting to new tasks, while existing Continual Learning (CL) methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to semantic misalignment between historical queries and stored video features. To address these two challenges, we propose FrameFusionMoE, a novel CTVR framework that comprises two key components: (1) the Frame Fusion Adapter (FFA), which captures temporal video dynamics while preserving model plasticity, and (2) the Task-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (TAME), which ensures consistent semantic alignment between queries across tasks and the stored video features. Thus, FrameFusionMoE enables effective adaptation to new video content while preserving historical text-video relevance to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We comprehensively evaluate FrameFusionMoE on two benchmark datasets under various task settings. Results demonstrate that FrameFusionMoE outperforms existing CL and TVR methods, achieving superior retrieval performance with minimal degradation on earlier tasks when handling continuous video streams.

| **[TC-MGC: Text-Conditioned Multi-Grained Contrastive Learning for Text-Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04707v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the success of coarse-grained or fine-grained contrast in text-video retrieval, there emerge multi-grained contrastive learning methods which focus on the integration of contrasts with different granularity. However, due to the wider semantic range of videos, the text-agnostic video representations might encode misleading information not described in texts, thus impeding the model from capturing precise cross-modal semantic correspondence. To this end, we propose a Text-Conditioned Multi-Grained Contrast framework, dubbed TC-MGC. Specifically, our model employs a language-video attention block to generate aggregated frame and video representations conditioned on the word's and text's attention weights over frames. To filter unnecessary similarity interactions and decrease trainable parameters in the Interactive Similarity Aggregation (ISA) module, we design a Similarity Reorganization (SR) module to identify attentive similarities and reorganize cross-modal similarity vectors and matrices. Next, we argue that the imbalance problem among multigrained similarities may result in over- and under-representation issues. We thereby introduce an auxiliary Similarity Decorrelation Regularization (SDR) loss to facilitate cooperative relationship utilization by similarity variance minimization on matching text-video pairs. Finally, we present a Linear Softmax Aggregation (LSA) module to explicitly encourage the interactions between multiple similarities and promote the usage of multi-grained information. Empirically, TC-MGC achieves competitive results on multiple text-video retrieval benchmarks, outperforming X-CLIP model by +2.8% (+1.3%), +2.2% (+1.0%), +1.5% (+0.9%) relative (absolute) improvements in text-to-video retrieval R@1 on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo and VATEX, respectively.

We introduce a unified framework that combines a visual matching stream and an aural matching stream with a unique subtitles-based video segmentation approach. Additionally, the aural stream includes a complementary audio-based two-stage retrieval mechanism that enhances performance on long-duration videos. Considering the complex nature of retrieval from lengthy videos and its corresponding evaluation, we introduce a new retrieval evaluation method specifically designed for long-video retrieval to support further research. We conducted experiments on the YouCook2 benchmark, showing promising retrieval performance.</p></details> |  |

The rapid growth of video content on social platforms and streaming services, along with privacy concerns, has increased the need for contextual advertising. Placing the right ad in the right context creates a seamless and pleasant ad viewing experience, resulting in higher audience engagement and, ultimately, better ad monetization. From a technology standpoint, effective contextual advertising requires a video retrieval system capable of understanding complex video content at a very granular level. Current text-to-video retrieval models based on joint multimodal training demand large datasets and computational resources, limiting their practicality and lacking the key functionalities required for ad ecosystem integration. We introduce ContextIQ, a multimodal expert-based video retrieval system designed specifically for contextual advertising. ContextIQ utilizes modality-specific experts-video, audio, transcript (captions), and metadata such as objects, actions, emotion, etc.-to create semantically rich video representations. We show that our system, without joint training, achieves better or comparable results to state-of-the-art models and commercial solutions on multiple text-to-video retrieval benchmarks. Our ablation studies highlight the benefits of leveraging multiple modalities for enhanced video retrieval accuracy instead of using a vision-language model alone. Furthermore, we show how video retrieval systems such as ContextIQ can be used for contextual advertising in an ad ecosystem while also addressing concerns related to brand safety and filtering inappropriate content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Narrating the Video: Boosting Text-Video Retrieval via Comprehensive Utilization of Frame-Level Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05186v4)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent text-video retrieval, the use of additional captions from vision-language models has shown promising effects on the performance. However, existing models using additional captions often have struggled to capture the rich semantics, including temporal changes, inherent in the video. In addition, incorrect information caused by generative models can lead to inaccurate retrieval. To address these issues, we propose a new framework, Narrating the Video (NarVid), which strategically leverages the comprehensive information available from frame-level captions, the narration. The proposed NarVid exploits narration in multiple ways: 1) feature enhancement through cross-modal interactions between narration and video, 2) query-aware adaptive filtering to suppress irrelevant or incorrect information, 3) dual-modal matching score by adding query-video similarity and query-narration similarity, and 4) hard-negative loss to learn discriminative features from multiple perspectives using the two similarities from different views. Experimental results demonstrate that NarVid achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Video-ColBERT is built upon 3 main components: a fine-grained spatial and temporal token-wise interaction, query and visual expansions, and a dual sigmoid loss during training. We find that this interaction and training paradigm leads to strong individual, yet compatible, representations for encoding video content. These representations lead to increases in performance on common text-to-video retrieval benchmarks compared to other bi-encoder methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025. 13 pages, 4 figures.

The existing video retrieval and caption benchmarks only include short descriptions, limits their ability of detailed video understanding evaluation. To address this problem, we present CaReBench, a testing benchmark for fine-grained video captioning and retrieval with 1,000 high-quality pairs of videos and human-annotated detailed captions. Uniquely, it provides manually separated spatial annotations and temporal annotations for each video. Based on this design, we introduce two evaluation metrics, ReBias and CapST, specifically tailored for video retrieval and video captioning tasks, respectively. These metrics enable a comprehensive investigation into the spatial and temporal biases inherent in VLMs. In addition, to handle both video retrieval and video captioning tasks in a unified framework, we develop a simple baseline based on a Multimodal Language Model (MLLM). By implementing a two-stage Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), we fully unlock the potential of MLLM, enabling it not only to generate detailed video descriptions but also to extract video features. Surprisingly, experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the CLIP-based models designed for retrieval and the popular MLLMs skilled in video captioning, our baseline shows competitive performance in both fine-grained video retrieval and video detailed captioning.</p></details> |  |

Yet, traditional approaches demand substantial computing power and are often bottlenecked by GPU memory. To tackle this issue, we present Long-Video Memory Network, Long-VMNet, a novel video understanding method that employs a fixed-size memory representation to store discriminative patches sampled from the input video. Long-VMNet achieves improved efficiency by leveraging a neural sampler that identifies discriminative tokens. Additionally, Long-VMNet only needs one scan through the video, greatly boosting efficiency. Our results on the Rest-ADL dataset demonstrate an 18x -- 75x improvement in inference times for long-form video retrieval and answering questions, with a competitive predictive performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[TempMe: Video Temporal Token Merging for Efficient Text-Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01156v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most text-video retrieval methods utilize the text-image pre-trained models like CLIP as a backbone. These methods process each sampled frame independently by the image encoder, resulting in high computational overhead and limiting practical deployment. Addressing this, we focus on efficient text-video retrieval by tackling two key challenges: 1. From the perspective of trainable parameters, current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods incur high inference costs; 2. From the perspective of model complexity, current token compression methods are mainly designed for images to reduce spatial redundancy but overlook temporal redundancy in consecutive frames of a video. To tackle these challenges, we propose Temporal Token Merging (TempMe), a parameter-efficient and training-inference efficient text-video retrieval architecture that minimizes trainable parameters and model complexity. Specifically, we introduce a progressive multi-granularity framework. By gradually combining neighboring clips, we reduce spatio-temporal redundancy and enhance temporal modeling across different frames, leading to improved efficiency and performance. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our TempMe. Compared to previous parameter-efficient text-video retrieval methods, TempMe achieves superior performance with just 0.50M trainable parameters. It significantly reduces output tokens by 95% and GFLOPs by 51%, while achieving a 1.8X speedup and a 4.4% R-Sum improvement. With full fine-tuning, TempMe achieves a significant 7.9% R-Sum improvement, trains 1.57X faster, and utilizes 75.2% GPU memory usage.

A key challenge in TVR is the information asymmetry between video and text: videos are inherently richer in information, while their textual descriptions often capture only fragments of this complexity. This paper introduces a novel, data-centric framework to bridge this gap by enriching textual representations to better match the richness of video content. During training, videos are segmented into event-level clips and captioned to ensure comprehensive coverage. During retrieval, a large language model (LLM) generates semantically diverse queries to capture a broader range of possible matches. To enhance retrieval efficiency, we propose a query selection mechanism that identifies the most relevant and diverse queries, reducing computational cost while improving accuracy. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the power of data-centric approaches in addressing information asymmetry in TVR. This work paves the way for new research focused on leveraging data to improve cross-modal retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, our empirical results indicate that existing LMM-based embedding models trained with the standard InfoNCE loss exhibit a high degree of overlap in similarity distribution between positive and negative pairs, making it challenging to distinguish hard negative pairs effectively. To deal with this issue, we propose a simple yet effective framework that dynamically improves the embedding model's representation learning for negative pairs based on their discriminative difficulty. Within this framework, we train a series of models, named LLaVE, and evaluate them on the MMEB benchmark, which covers 4 meta-tasks and 36 datasets. Experimental results show that LLaVE establishes stronger baselines that achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while demonstrating strong scalability and efficiency. Specifically, LLaVE-2B surpasses the previous SOTA 7B models, while LLaVE-7B achieves a further performance improvement of 6.2 points. Although LLaVE is trained on image-text data, it can generalize to text-video retrieval tasks in a zero-shot manner and achieve strong performance, demonstrating its remarkable potential for transfer to other embedding tasks.</p></details> | Preprint |

Narrative event descriptions provide context-rich information, enhancing a system's future planning and decision-making capabilities. We propose a novel task: $\textit{long-term future narration generation}$, which extends beyond traditional action anticipation by generating detailed narrations of future daily activities. We introduce a visual-language model, ViNa, specifically designed to address this challenging task. ViNa integrates long-term videos and corresponding narrations to generate a sequence of future narrations that predict subsequent events and actions over extended time horizons. ViNa extends existing multimodal models that perform only short-term predictions or describe observed videos by generating long-term future narrations for a broader range of daily activities. We also present a novel downstream application that leverages the generated narrations called future video retrieval to help users improve planning for a task by visualizing the future. We evaluate future narration generation on the largest egocentric dataset Ego4D.</p></details> |  |

In particular, text-video retrieval, which aims to find the top matching videos given text descriptions from a vast video corpus, is an essential function, the primary challenge of which is to bridge the modality gap. Nevertheless, most existing approaches treat texts merely as discrete tokens and neglect their syntax structures. Moreover, the abundant spatial and temporal clues in videos are often underutilized due to the lack of interaction with text. To address these issues, we argue that using texts as guidance to focus on relevant temporal frames and spatial regions within videos is beneficial. In this paper, we propose a novel Syntax-Hierarchy-Enhanced text-video retrieval method (SHE-Net) that exploits the inherent semantic and syntax hierarchy of texts to bridge the modality gap from two perspectives. First, to facilitate a more fine-grained integration of visual content, we employ the text syntax hierarchy, which reveals the grammatical structure of text descriptions, to guide the visual representations. Second, to further enhance the multi-modal interaction and alignment, we also utilize the syntax hierarchy to guide the similarity calculation. We evaluated our method on four public text-video retrieval datasets of MSR-VTT, MSVD, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet. The experimental results and ablation studies confirm the advantages of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

While prior work focuses on mitigating hallucinations, we instead explore leveraging hallucination correction as a training objective to improve video-language alignment. We introduce HACA, a self-training framework learning to correct hallucinations in descriptions that do not align with the video content. By identifying and correcting inconsistencies, HACA enhances the model's ability to align video and textual representations for spatio-temporal reasoning. Our experimental results show consistent gains in video-caption binding and text-to-video retrieval tasks, demonstrating that hallucination correction-inspired tasks serve as an effective strategy for improving vision and language alignment.</p></details> |  |

Most existing TVR methods are based on large-scale pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP). However, due to the inherent plain structure of CLIP, few TVR methods explore the multi-scale representations which offer richer contextual information for a more thorough understanding. To this end, we propose MUSE, a multi-scale mamba with linear computational complexity for efficient cross-resolution modeling. Specifically, the multi-scale representations are generated by applying a feature pyramid on the last single-scale feature map. Then, we employ the Mamba structure as an efficient multi-scale learner to jointly learn scale-wise representations. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive studies to investigate different model structures and designs.

However, existing video retrieval datasets suffer from scope limitations, primarily focusing on matching descriptive but vague queries with small collections of professionally edited, English-centric videos. To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{MultiVENT 2.0}$, a large-scale, multilingual event-centric video retrieval benchmark featuring a collection of more than 218,000 news videos and 3,906 queries targeting specific world events. These queries specifically target information found in the visual content, audio, embedded text, and text metadata of the videos, requiring systems leverage all these sources to succeed at the task. Preliminary results show that state-of-the-art vision-language models struggle significantly with this task, and while alternative approaches show promise, they are still insufficient to adequately address this problem. These findings underscore the need for more robust multimodal retrieval systems, as effective video retrieval is a crucial step towards multimodal content understanding and generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Branch Collaborative Learning Network for Video Quality Assessment in Industrial Video Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05924v1)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Quality Assessment (VQA) is vital for large-scale video retrieval systems, aimed at identifying quality issues to prioritize high-quality videos. In industrial systems, low-quality video characteristics fall into four categories: visual-related issues like mosaics and black boxes, textual issues from video titles and OCR content, and semantic issues like frame incoherence and frame-text mismatch from AI-generated videos. Despite their prevalence in industrial settings, these low-quality videos have been largely overlooked in academic research, posing a challenge for accurate identification. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Branch Collaborative Network (MBCN) tailored for industrial video retrieval systems. MBCN features four branches, each designed to tackle one of the aforementioned quality issues. After each branch independently scores videos, we aggregate these scores using a weighted approach and a squeeze-and-excitation mechanism to dynamically address quality issues across different scenarios. We implement point-wise and pair-wise optimization objectives to ensure score stability and reasonableness. Extensive offline and online experiments on a world-level video search engine demonstrate MBCN's effectiveness in identifying video quality issues, significantly enhancing the retrieval system's ranking performance. Detailed experimental analyses confirm the positive contribution of all four evaluation branches. Furthermore, MBCN significantly improves recognition accuracy for low-quality AI-generated videos compared to the baseline.</p></details> | KDD 2025 ADS |

In this study, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model is used to annotate surveillance videos in an unsupervised manner. In scene understanding methods, some of the learned patterns are ambiguous and represents a mixture of atomic actions. To address the ambiguity issue in the proposed method, feature vectors, and the primary model are processed to obtain a secondary model which describes the scene with primitive patterns that lack any ambiguity. Experiments show performance improvement in the retrieval task compared to other topic model-based methods. In terms of false positive and true positive responses, the proposed method achieves at least 80\% and 124\% improvement respectively. Four search strategies are proposed, and users can define and search for a variety of activities using the proposed query formulation which is based on topic models. In addition, the lightweight database in our method occupies much fewer storage which in turn speeds up the search procedure compared to the methods which are based on low-level features.</p></details> |  |

As an important subfield, video-language representation learning focuses on learning representations using global semantic interactions between pre-defined video-text pairs. However, to enhance and refine such coarse-grained global interactions, more detailed interactions are necessary for fine-grained multimodal learning. In this study, we introduce a new approach that models video-text as game players using multivariate cooperative game theory to handle uncertainty during fine-grained semantic interactions with diverse granularity, flexible combination, and vague intensity. Specifically, we design the Hierarchical Banzhaf Interaction to simulate the fine-grained correspondence between video clips and textual words from hierarchical perspectives. Furthermore, to mitigate the bias in calculations within Banzhaf Interaction, we propose reconstructing the representation through a fusion of single-modal and cross-modal components. This reconstructed representation ensures fine granularity comparable to that of the single-modal representation, while also preserving the adaptive encoding characteristics of cross-modal representation. Additionally, we extend our original structure into a flexible encoder-decoder framework, enabling the model to adapt to various downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on commonly used text-video retrieval, video-question answering, and video captioning benchmarks, with superior performance, validate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2303.14369</p></details> |

However, identifying the best music for a video can be a difficult and time-consuming task. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for automatically retrieving a matching music clip for a given video, and vice versa. Our approach leverages annotated music labels, as well as the inherent artistic correspondence between visual and music elements. Distinct from previous cross-modal music retrieval works, our method combines both self-supervised and supervised training objectives. We use self-supervised and label-supervised contrastive learning to train a joint embedding space between music and video. We show the effectiveness of our approach by using music genre labels for the supervised training component, and our framework can be generalized to other music annotations (e.g., emotion, instrument, etc.). Furthermore, our method enables fine-grained control over how much the retrieval process focuses on self-supervised vs. label information at inference time. We evaluate the learned embeddings through a variety of video-to-music and music-to-video retrieval tasks. Our experiments show that the proposed approach successfully combines self-supervised and supervised objectives and is effective for controllable music-video retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

To address this problem, fine-tuning long-context LVLMs and employing GPT-based agents have emerged as promising solutions. However, fine-tuning LVLMs would require extensive high-quality data and substantial GPU resources, while GPT-based agents would rely on proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o). In this paper, we propose Video Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Video-RAG), a training-free and cost-effective pipeline that employs visually-aligned auxiliary texts to help facilitate cross-modality alignment while providing additional information beyond the visual content. Specifically, we leverage open-source external tools to extract visually-aligned information from pure video data (e.g., audio, optical character, and object detection), and incorporate the extracted information into an existing LVLM as auxiliary texts, alongside video frames and queries, in a plug-and-play manner. Our Video-RAG offers several key advantages: (i) lightweight with low computing overhead due to single-turn retrieval; (ii) easy implementation and compatibility with any LVLM; and (iii) significant, consistent performance gains across long video understanding benchmarks, including Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench. Notably, our model demonstrates superior performance over proprietary models like Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o when utilized with a 72B model.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Specifically, we use text-to-text retrieval to find relevant videos for a medical question based on the similarity of video transcript and answers generated by GPT4. For the visual answer localization, the start and end timestamps of the answer are predicted by the alignments on both visual content and subtitles with queries. For the Query-Focused Instructional Step Captioning (QFISC) task, the step captions are generated by GPT4. Specifically, we provide the video captions generated by the LLaVA-Next-Video model and the video subtitles with timestamps as context, and ask GPT4 to generate step captions for the given medical query. We only submit one run for evaluation and it obtains a F-score of 11.92 and mean IoU of 9.6527.</p></details> |  |
| **[Query-centric Audio-Visual Cognition Network for Moment Retrieval, Segmentation and Step-Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13543v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video has emerged as a favored multimedia format on the internet. To better gain video contents, a new topic HIREST is presented, including video retrieval, moment retrieval, moment segmentation, and step-captioning. The pioneering work chooses the pre-trained CLIP-based model for video retrieval, and leverages it as a feature extractor for other three challenging tasks solved in a multi-task learning paradigm. Nevertheless, this work struggles to learn the comprehensive cognition of user-preferred content, due to disregarding the hierarchies and association relations across modalities. In this paper, guided by the shallow-to-deep principle, we propose a query-centric audio-visual cognition (QUAG) network to construct a reliable multi-modal representation for moment retrieval, segmentation and step-captioning. Specifically, we first design the modality-synergistic perception to obtain rich audio-visual content, by modeling global contrastive alignment and local fine-grained interaction between visual and audio modalities. Then, we devise the query-centric cognition that uses the deep-level query to perform the temporal-channel filtration on the shallow-level audio-visual representation. This can cognize user-preferred content and thus attain a query-centric audio-visual representation for three tasks. Extensive experiments show QUAG achieves the SOTA results on HIREST. Further, we test QUAG on the query-based video summarization task and verify its good generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Despite these advancements, achieving accurate matching in TVR remains challenging due to inherent disparities between video and textual modalities and irregularities in data representation. In this paper, we propose Text-Video-ProxyNet (TV-ProxyNet), a novel framework designed to decompose the conventional 1-to-N relationship of TVR into N distinct 1-to-1 relationships. By replacing a single text query with a series of text proxies, TV-ProxyNet not only broadens the query scope but also achieves a more precise expansion. Each text proxy is crafted through a refined iterative process, controlled by mechanisms we term as the director and dash, which regulate the proxy's direction and distance relative to the original text query. This setup not only facilitates more precise semantic alignment but also effectively manages the disparities and noise inherent in multimodal data. Our experiments on three representative video-text retrieval benchmarks, MSRVTT, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet Captions, demonstrate the effectiveness of TV-ProxyNet. The results show an improvement of 2.0% to 3.3% in R@1 over the baseline. TV-ProxyNet achieved state-of-the-art performance on MSRVTT and ActivityNet Captions, and a 2.0% improvement on DiDeMo compared to existing methods, validating our approach's ability to enhance semantic mapping and reduce error propensity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Semantic Communication: Architectures, Technologies, and Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08642v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper delves into the applications of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in semantic communication (SemCom) and presents a thorough study. Three popular SemCom systems enabled by classical GAI models are first introduced, including variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. For each system, the fundamental concept of the GAI model, the corresponding SemCom architecture, and the associated literature review of recent efforts are elucidated. Then, a novel generative SemCom system is proposed by incorporating the cutting-edge GAI technology-large language models (LLMs). This system features two LLM-based AI agents at both the transmitter and receiver, serving as "brains" to enable powerful information understanding and content regeneration capabilities, respectively. This innovative design allows the receiver to directly generate the desired content, instead of recovering the bit stream, based on the coded semantic information conveyed by the transmitter. Therefore, it shifts the communication mindset from "information recovery" to "information regeneration" and thus ushers in a new era of generative SemCom. A case study on point-to-point video retrieval is presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed generative SemCom system, showcasing a 99.98% reduction in communication overhead and a 53% improvement in retrieval accuracy compared to the traditional communication system. Furthermore, four typical application scenarios for generative SemCom are delineated, followed by a discussion of three open issues warranting future investigation. In a nutshell, this paper provides a holistic set of guidelines for applying GAI in SemCom, paving the way for the efficient implementation of generative SemCom in future wireless networks.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Multimodal Contextualized Support for Enhancing Video Retrieval System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07584v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video retrieval systems, especially those used in competitions, primarily focus on querying individual keyframes or images rather than encoding an entire clip or video segment. However, queries often describe an action or event over a series of frames, not a specific image. This results in insufficient information when analyzing a single frame, leading to less accurate query results. Moreover, extracting embeddings solely from images (keyframes) does not provide enough information for models to encode higher-level, more abstract insights inferred from the video. These models tend to only describe the objects present in the frame, lacking a deeper understanding. In this work, we propose a system that integrates the latest methodologies, introducing a novel pipeline that extracts multimodal data, and incorporate information from multiple frames within a video, enabling the model to abstract higher-level information that captures latent meanings, focusing on what can be inferred from the video clip, rather than just focusing on object detection in one single image.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

This neglects the richness and variety of possible valid descriptions of a video, which could range anywhere from moment-by-moment detail to a single phrase summary. To provide a more thorough evaluation of the capabilities of long video retrieval systems, we propose a pipeline that leverages state-of-the-art large language models to carefully generate a diverse set of synthetic captions for long videos. We validate this pipeline's fidelity via rigorous human inspection. We use synthetic captions from this pipeline to perform a benchmark of a representative set of video language models using long video datasets, and show that the models struggle on shorter captions. We show that finetuning on this data can both mitigate these issues (+2.8% R@1 over SOTA on ActivityNet with diverse captions), and even improve performance on standard paragraph-to-video retrieval (+1.0% R@1 on ActivityNet). We also use synthetic data from our pipeline as query expansion in the zero-shot setting (+3.4% R@1 on ActivityNet). We derive insights by analyzing failure cases for retrieval with short captions.

| **[CoVR-2: Automatic Data Construction for Composed Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14746v4)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CoIR) has recently gained popularity as a task that considers both text and image queries together, to search for relevant images in a database. Most CoIR approaches require manually annotated datasets, comprising image-text-image triplets, where the text describes a modification from the query image to the target image. However, manual curation of CoIR triplets is expensive and prevents scalability. In this work, we instead propose a scalable automatic dataset creation methodology that generates triplets given video-caption pairs, while also expanding the scope of the task to include composed video retrieval (CoVR). To this end, we mine paired videos with a similar caption from a large database, and leverage a large language model to generate the corresponding modification text. Applying this methodology to the extensive WebVid2M collection, we automatically construct our WebVid-CoVR dataset, resulting in 1.6 million triplets. Moreover, we introduce a new benchmark for CoVR with a manually annotated evaluation set, along with baseline results. We further validate that our methodology is equally applicable to image-caption pairs, by generating 3.3 million CoIR training triplets using the Conceptual Captions dataset. Our model builds on BLIP-2 pretraining, adapting it to composed video (or image) retrieval, and incorporates an additional caption retrieval loss to exploit extra supervision beyond the triplet. We provide extensive ablations to analyze the design choices on our new CoVR benchmark. Our experiments also demonstrate that training a CoVR model on our datasets effectively transfers to CoIR, leading to improved state-of-the-art performance in the zero-shot setup on the CIRR, FashionIQ, and CIRCO benchmarks.

| **[Why Foundation Models in Pathology Are Failing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23807v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In non-medical domains, foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized computer vision and language processing through large-scale self-supervised and multimodal learning. Consequently, their rapid adoption in computational pathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis, prognostication, and multimodal retrieval. However, recent systematic evaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses: low diagnostic accuracy, poor robustness, geometric instability, heavy computational demands, and concerning safety vulnerabilities. This short paper examines these shortcomings and argues that they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions underlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream AI and the intrinsic complexity of human tissue. Seven interrelated causes are identified: biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization, excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation, insufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size. These findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain conceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a fundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself.</p></details> |  |

As audiovisual media becomes a prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality judgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three prominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the limitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic evaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess multimodal RAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/alexmartin1722/mirage</p></details> |

However, existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval strategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of retrieved information, leading to three critical challenges: determining when to retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved information effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce Windsock, a query-dependent module making decisions on retrieval necessity and modality selection, effectively reducing computational overhead and improving response quality. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction Tuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize retrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we adopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert question-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the generation quality by 17.07% while reducing 8.95% retrieval times.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 UniReps Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Open Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Factual Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22521v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in generating photorealistic and prompt-aligned images, but they often produce outputs that contradict verifiable knowledge, especially when prompts involve fine-grained attributes or time-sensitive events. Conventional retrieval-augmented approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing external information, yet they are fundamentally incapable of grounding generation in accurate and evolving knowledge due to their reliance on static sources and shallow evidence integration. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORIG, an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework for Factual Image Generation (FIG), a new task that requires both visual realism and factual grounding. ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence from the web and incrementally integrates the refined knowledge into enriched prompts to guide generation. To support systematic evaluation, we build FIG-Eval, a benchmark spanning ten categories across perceptual, compositional, and temporal dimensions. Experiments demonstrate that ORIG substantially improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines, highlighting the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image generation.</p></details> | Preprint |

This paper introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes, and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved. Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1 achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability, as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[TRACE: Grounding Time Series in Context for Multimodal Embedding and Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09114v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ubiquity of dynamic data in domains such as weather, healthcare, and energy underscores a growing need for effective interpretation and retrieval of time-series data. These data are inherently tied to domain-specific contexts, such as clinical notes or weather narratives, making cross-modal retrieval essential not only for downstream tasks but also for developing robust time-series foundation models by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite the increasing demand, time-series retrieval remains largely underexplored. Existing methods often lack semantic grounding, struggle to align heterogeneous modalities, and have limited capacity for handling multi-channel signals. To address this gap, we propose TRACE, a generic multimodal retriever that grounds time-series embeddings in aligned textual context. TRACE enables fine-grained channel-level alignment and employs hard negative mining to facilitate semantically meaningful retrieval. It supports flexible cross-modal retrieval modes, including Text-to-Timeseries and Timeseries-to-Text, effectively linking linguistic descriptions with complex temporal patterns. By retrieving semantically relevant pairs, TRACE enriches downstream models with informative context, leading to improved predictive accuracy and interpretability. Beyond a static retrieval engine, TRACE also serves as a powerful standalone encoder, with lightweight task-specific tuning that refines context-aware representations while maintaining strong cross-modal alignment. These representations achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream forecasting and classification tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple domains highlight its dual utility, as both an effective encoder for downstream applications and a general-purpose retriever to enhance time-series models.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCA: Modality Composition Awareness for Robust Composed Multimodal Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15543v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval, which seeks to retrieve relevant content across modalities such as text or image, supports applications from AI search to contents production. Despite the success of separate-encoder approaches like CLIP align modality-specific embeddings with contrastive learning, recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable a unified encoder that directly processes composed inputs. While flexible and advanced, we identify that unified encoders trained with conventional contrastive learning are prone to learn modality shortcut, leading to poor robustness under distribution shifts. We propose a modality composition awareness framework to mitigate this issue. Concretely, a preference loss enforces multimodal embeddings to outperform their unimodal counterparts, while a composition regularization objective aligns multimodal embeddings with prototypes composed from its unimodal parts. These objectives explicitly model structural relationships between the composed representation and its unimodal counterparts. Experiments on various benchmarks show gains in out-of-distribution retrieval, highlighting modality composition awareness as a effective principle for robust composed multimodal retrieval when utilizing MLLMs as the unified encoder.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Beyond Context: A Survey of Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Document Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15253v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document understanding is critical for applications from financial analysis to scientific discovery. Current approaches, whether OCR-based pipelines feeding Large Language Models (LLMs) or native Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), face key limitations: the former loses structural detail, while the latter struggles with context modeling. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps ground models in external data, but documents' multimodal nature, i.e., combining text, tables, charts, and layout, demands a more advanced paradigm: Multimodal RAG. This approach enables holistic retrieval and reasoning across all modalities, unlocking comprehensive document intelligence. Recognizing its importance, this paper presents a systematic survey of Multimodal RAG for document understanding. We propose a taxonomy based on domain, retrieval modality, and granularity, and review advances involving graph structures and agentic frameworks. We also summarize key datasets, benchmarks, and applications, and highlight open challenges in efficiency, fine-grained representation, and robustness, providing a roadmap for future progress in document AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Supervised Fine-Tuning or Contrastive Learning? Towards Better Multimodal LLM Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14824v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders, various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts ''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components: weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and applications in this area.</p></details> |  |

Such documents often combine text, images, tables, equations, and graphs, each contributing unique information. In this work, we present a Modality-Aware Hybrid retrieval Architecture (MAHA), designed specifically for multimodal question answering with reasoning through a modality-aware knowledge graph. MAHA integrates dense vector retrieval with structured graph traversal, where the knowledge graph encodes cross-modal semantics and relationships. This design enables both semantically rich and context-aware retrieval across diverse modalities. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that MAHA substantially outperforms baseline methods, achieving a ROUGE-L score of 0.486, providing complete modality coverage. These results highlight MAHA's ability to combine embeddings with explicit document structure, enabling effective multimodal retrieval. Our work establishes a scalable and interpretable retrieval framework that advances RAG systems by enabling modality-aware reasoning over unstructured multimodal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, submitted for review</p></details> |
